## Books and links

Our own teaching materials are available at [Obdurodon](http://dh.obdurodon.org) and [Newtfire](https://newtfire.org/courses/).

### XPath

There are no XPath-specific reference books, but XPath is discussed in  the books about XQuery and XSLT listed below. XPath functions through version 3.1 are documented on line in the [Function library](https://www.saxonica.com/documentation/index.html#!functions) section of the documentation for [Saxon](http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/documentation.xml). The Mulberry Technologies [XPath 2.0 Quick Reference](http://mulberrytech.com/quickref/xpath2.pdf) and [XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Functions and Operators Quick Reference](http://mulberrytech.com/quickref/functions.pdf) by Sam Wilmott are excellent, but they do not include more recent features. 

### XQuery

The only general XQuery book you need is Priscilla Walmsley, _XQuery_, 2nd edition, 2015, O’Reilly. It contains documentation of both XPath functions used in XQuery and XQuery itself.  XQuery and XPath share a function library, so the XPath references above also pertain to XQuery. The Mulberry Technologies [XQuery 1.0 Quick Reference](http://mulberrytech.com/quickref/xquery1.pdf) and [XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Functions and Operators Quick Reference](http://mulberrytech.com/quickref/functions.pdf) by Sam Wilmott are excellent, but they do not include more recent features. 

One of the best resources for exploring and building with XQuery is the [eXist-db XML database](https://exist-db.org). We have prepared [instructions for installing eXist-db on your own computer](xquery_setup.html), so that you can upload and work with your own files. If you use eXist-db as your XML database, we also recommend Erik Siegel and Adam Retter, _eXist: a NoSQL document database and application platform_, O’Reilly, 2014. If you use eXist-db, you should also subscribe to the [exist-open](https://sourceforge.net/projects/exist/lists/exist-open) mailing list.

### XSLT

The best XSLT reference book is Michael Kay, _XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0 Programmer’s Reference_, 4th edition, Wrox, 2008, but it has not been updated for XPath 3.1 or XSLT 3.0. There are no XSLT 3.0 reference books, but XSLT 3.0 elements are documented on line in the [XSLT elements](https://www.saxonica.com/documentation/index.html#!xsl-elements) section of the documentation for [Saxon](http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/documentation.xml). The Mulberry Technologies [XSLT 2.0 Quick Reference ](http://mulberrytech.com/quickref/xslt2.pdf) by Sam Wilmott is excellent, but it does not include more recent features. You should subscribe to the [XSLT mailing list](https://www.mulberrytech.com/xsl/xsl-list/).

### Schematron

There are no Schematron books, but for a good Schematron tutorial on line see Mulberry Technologies’ [Introduction to Schematron](http://www.mulberrytech.com/papers/schematron-Philly.pdf), by Wendell Piez and Debbie Lapeyre. See also the Mulberry Technologies [ISO Schematron Quick Reference](http://mulberrytech.com/quickref/schematron_rev1.pdf), by Sam Wilmott.
