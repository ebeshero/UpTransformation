    <poem>
        <lb n="1"/>I met a traveller from an antique land,
        <lb n="2"/>Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone 
        <lb n="3"/>Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
        <lb n="4"/>Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
        <lb n="5"/>And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
        <lb n="6"/>Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
        <lb n="7"/>Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
        <lb n="8"/>The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
        <lb n="9"/>And on the pedestal, these words appear:
        <lb n="10"/>My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
        <lb n="11"/>Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
        <lb n="12"/>Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
        <lb n="13"/>Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
        <lb n="14"/>The lone and level sands stretch far away.”
