               <name type="person" ref="11" rend="italic">Royal Society,</name> by their Order
          for the making and <lb/>publishing of this Catalogue, had begun: they ha<lb break="no"/>ving done the same, as with regard to Common <lb/>Use; so to return
          that which is but Right to your <lb/>Self, and that they might always wear this Cata<lb break="no"/>logue, as the Miniature of your abundant Respects,

                     <reg>s</reg>
                  </choice> to the following Catalogue, I have some things to say, of the Or<lb break="no"/>der, Names, Descriptions, Figures, and Uses of Particulars, <lb/>and
            the Quotations I have made therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">As to the first, I like not the reason which <name type="person" ref="122" rend="italic">Aldrovandus</name> gives <lb/>for his beginning
          the History of <hi rend="italic">Quadrupeds</hi> with the Horse; <hi rend="italic">Quòd prae<lb break="no"/>cipuam nobis utilitatem
              praebeat.</hi> Being better placed according to the de<lb break="no"/>grees of their Approximation, to Humane Shape, and one to another: and
          <lb/>so other Things, according to their Nature. Much less should I choose, <lb/>with <name type="person" ref="121" rend="italic">Gesner</name>, to go by the Alphabet. The very Scale of the Creatures, is a <lb/>matter of high speculation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">As to the Names, where they were wanting, (which in our own Lan<lb break="no"/>guage were many) I have taken leave to give them. But have generally
          re<lb break="no"/>teind them, where I have found them all-ready given. Although, from some <lb/>distinguishing Note less convenient; as the Colour is,
          than the Figure. <lb/>And sometimes very Improper, as <hi rend="italic">Concha Persica,</hi> and the like, from the <lb/>Place. For it often
          falls out, that the same Thing breeds in many Places. <lb/>But there is no Natural Reason, why it should be called by one, rather than
          <lb/>another. So that the Names of Things should be always taken from some<lb break="no"/>thing more observably declarative of their Form, or Nature.
          The doing of <lb/>which, would much facilitate and Improve the Knowledge of them many ways. <lb/>For so, every Name were a short Definition.
          Where as if Words are con<lb break="no"/>fus'd, little else can be distinctly learn'd. Yet I took it not to be my part, <lb/>actually to reform this
          matter; unless I had been writing an Universal Histo<lb break="no"/>ry of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">In the Descriptions, I have taken care; First, to rectifie the mistakes of <lb/>such as are given us by other Hands. Secondly, not to
          Transcribe any; as <lb/>is too commonly done: but having noted something more especial therein, to <lb/>refer to the Author. Thirdly, where
          there is no Description at all, or that <lb/>is too short, or the faults therein many, to give one at large. For the doing <lb/>of all
          which, what the trouble of comparing Books together hath been, I say <lb/>with <name type="person" ref="1916" rend="italic">Sleydan</name> in
            another Case,</hi> Post Deum Immortalem Ipse novi.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">In the Descriptions given, I have observed, with the Figures of Things, <lb/>also their Colours; so far as I could, unless I had view'd
          them Living, and <lb/>Fresh. And have added their just Measures. Much neglected by Writers <lb/>of Natural History.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">If any object against their length: perhaps they have not so well considered <lb/>the necessity hereof, for the cleer and evident
          distinction of the several Kinds <lb/>and Species, in so great a variety of Things known in the World. And wherein <lb/>also regard is to be
          had, to all that after Ages may discover, or have occasion <lb/>to enquire after. The Curiosity and Diligence of <name type="person" ref="141" rend="italic">Pliny</name>, is highly to be com<lb break="no"/>mended. Yet he is so brief, that his Works are rather a <hi rend="italic">Nomenclature,</hi> 
                  <lb/>than a History: which perhaps might be more intelligible to the Age he lived 
          
          <pb/>in, than the
          succeeding ones. But had He, and Others, been more parti<lb break="no"/>cular in the Matters they treat of: their Commentators had engaged their
          <lb/>own and their Readers Time much better, than in so many fruitless and end<lb break="no"/>less Disquisitions and Contests. It were certainly a
          Thing both in it self <lb/>Desirable, and of much Consequence; To have such an Inventory of Nature, <lb/>wherein, as on the one hand,
          nothing should be Wanting; so nothing Re<lb break="no"/>peated or Confounded, on the other. For which, there is no way without <lb/>a cleer and full
            Description of Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Besides, that in such Descriptions, many Particulars relating to the Na<lb break="no"/>ture and Use of Things, will occur to the Authors mind,
          which otherwise <lb/>he would never have thought of. And may give occasion to his Readers, for <lb/>the consideration of many more. And
          therefore it were also very proper, That <lb/>not only Things strange and rare, but the most known and common amongst <lb/>us, were thus
          describ'd. Not meerly, for that what is common in one Coun<lb break="no"/>trey, is rare in another: but because, likewise, it would yield a great
          aboun<lb break="no"/>dance of matter for any Man's Reason to work upon. He that notes, That <lb/>a Grey hound hath pricked Ears, but that those of a
          Hound hang down; <lb/>may also the Reason of both: for that the former hunts with his <hi rend="italic">Ears;</hi> 
                  <choice>
                     <sic>the the</sic>
                     <corr>
                        <lb/>the</corr>
                  </choice> latter, only
          with his <hi rend="italic">Nose:</hi> So that as a blind Man, minds nothing but <lb/>what he Hears: so a Hound, having his Ears half
          <hi rend="italic">Stop'd</hi> with the Flaps, <lb/>minds nothing but what he Smells. He that shall observe, That a Horse, <lb/>which
          ought to have many and strong Teeth, and large and thick Hoofes, <lb/>hath no Horns: and that an Ox, with Horns, hath fewer Teeth, and
          <lb/>weaker Hoofs: cannot but at the same time see the Providence of Nature, <lb/>In disposing of the same Excrementitious parts of the
          Blood, either way, as <lb/>is most suitable to the Animal. One that considers the Teeth of a Horse, sees <lb/>the reason, why he hath so
          long an upper Lip; which is his Hand, and in <lb/>some sort answers to the <hi rend="italic">Proboscis</hi> of an Elephant; whereby he
          nimbly <hi rend="italic">winds</hi> 
                  <lb/>the Grass in great quantities at once into his Mouth. So that for Nature <lb/>to have made him a
          short Lip, had been to make a little <hi rend="italic">Hopper,</hi> to a great <lb/>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mill.</hi> The same Animal having
          need of great Lungs, how necessary is it also <lb/>for him to have a broad Breast, well bowed Ribs, and wide Nostrils to give <lb/>them
          play? That being much pester'd with Flys, he should have a long brush <lb/>Tail to whisk them off. Whereas the Ass, which either for
          the hardness and <lb/>dryness of his Skin, or other Cause, is less anoy'd with them, hath no need of <lb/>such an one. That being heavy, he
          should not Tread or Leap stiff, as a Man; <lb/>but have a Pastern made him, gradually and safely to break the force of his <lb/>weight. By
          This, his Body hangs on the Hoof, as a Coach doth by the <lb/>Leathers. Without this, the most thorow pac'd Horse, would tread so <lb/>hard,
          that as it were impossible for any man to endure long upon his Back: <lb/>so his Joynts would be much chafed, and he must needs
          presently tyre. Yet <lb/>if it be too long, by yielding over much, it makes every step somewhat more <lb/>laborious, and to loose some
          ground. He that would have one for Carriage, <lb/>will choose him short, and high Back'd. For Runing, long, an clean or <lb/>slender Limb'd:
          another, were like a Man that should run a Race in his <lb/>Boots. And a due length is as necessary: which is, when the Measure be<lb break="no"/>tween
          the Main and the Tail answers to the hight, or thereabout. If much <lb/>under, his hinder Feet will want their full scope: if much
          over, there will <lb/>be more weight to be moved with the same force, as if the weight were less. <lb/>But he that would have one for
          Draught, looks not that the Limbs be slen<lb break="no"/>der, if they are strong; especially those behind. For though the fore Legs 
            
          <pb/>pull
          sometimes, most when they make an acute angle with the Belly; yet the <lb/>greatest stress usually lies upon the hinder; these being as
          the Centre of <lb/>Gravity, and the Load, and Body of the Horse, the two Counter Weights. <lb/>And when he Goes without Drawing, his fore
          Feet only support him; but <lb/>his hinder, serve also as Leavers to carry him on. And therefore when he <lb/>walks, he always moves his
            hinder Foot first.</hi>

                     </name>. It is <lb/>an entire one taken out of the
                    Royal Pyramids. <lb/>In length five feet and ½, defended with several linnen Co<lb break="no"/>vers, all woven like ordinary Flaxen
                    Cloth. But by the <lb/>spinning, distinguished into three kinds. The utmost, is <lb/>like Flaxen Cloth of two shillings an Ell: the
                    inmost, of <lb/>half a Crown: the middlemost, of three shillings, or there<lb break="no"/>about.</p>
                  <p>The utmost Cover is divided into several pieces, each of <lb/>doubled Linnen, and adapted in figure to the part it covers,<pb n="2"/> 
                     <lb/>as
                    one on the Breast, another on the Belly, and so on all <lb/>the principal Parts. On each of these pieces is laid a white <lb/>Paint,
                    of a kind of chalky or limy substance, of the thickness <lb/>of a Hen-Egg-shell. Upon this chalky ground are drawn <lb/>the Hieroglyphick Figures 
                    of Men, Women and Birds; in <lb/>Gold, yellow, red and blew. But with very rude shapes, <lb/>and the Colours no
                    where mixed together. So very mean <lb/>was the Art of Painting amongst the <name type="place" ref="236" rend="italic">Ægyptians</name> here<lb break="no"/>tofore. For we have reason to believe, that what was <lb/>done for one of their Kings or
                    Nobles, was done with their <lb/>best skill. </p>
                  <p>The middlemost Cover consisteth of one single and <lb/>entire piece of Linnen, almost like a Winding-sheet. It is <lb/>also tinged
                    with some kind of Paint, but very lightly, and <lb/>without any Figures. </p>
                  <p>The inmost Covering is wrapped round about the Head, <lb/>Trunk, each Arm, and each Leg apart, about thirty or <lb/>forty times, like
                    so many swathing Bands. About twenty <lb/>of the utmost of these folds are lightly tinged, all the other <lb/>inmost more fully,
                    with a blackish and gummous substance. <lb/>But the Flesh so fully, as it seems to be converted into a <lb/>black Rosin; which being
                    held to the flame of a Candle, is <lb/>a little odorous and inflamable. The Bones also, are not only <lb/>outwardly, but also quite
                    through of a black colour, as if <lb/>they were burnt. </p>
                  <p>From hence it is very probable, That the way of Em<lb break="no"/>balming amongst the <name type="place" ref="236" rend="italic">Ægyptians</name>, was by boiling the Body <lb/>(in a long Cauldron like a Fish-kettle) in some kind of liquid
                    <lb/>Balsome; so long, till the aqueous parts of the flesh being <lb/>evaporated, the oily and gummous parts of the Balsome did <lb/>by
                    degrees soak into it, and intimately incorporate there<lb break="no"/>with. Much after the same manner, as the Sugar doth, in <lb/>the
                    conditing of Pears, Quinces, and the like. </p>
                  <p>'Tis also likely, that a better way might be taken, than <lb/>this used by the <name type="place" ref="236" rend="italic">Ægyptians</name>. And that is, by boyling, or <lb/>rather soaking the Body in some white sort of Oyl, and <lb/>such as
                    will dry, (as that of Walnuts) made and kept <lb/>so hot, as to evaporate the watery parts by degrees, and to <lb/>keep the flesh
                    white, and not brittle, but limber and plient. <lb/>Which, especially in the business of Anatomy, would be <lb/>of good use:
                    because, that all the Muscules of the Body,<pb n="3"/> 
                     <lb/>being first parted one from another, might hereby be pre<lb break="no"/>served sound, clean,
                    and limber upon the Bones; and so all <lb/>the motions of the parts be explicated with the greatest ease, <lb/>and without any
                    offensiveness. </p>
                  <p>'Tis equally probable, that the whole Compages of the <lb/>Muscules, as they lie upon the Bones, might with little <lb/>trouble, and
                    less charge than by the former way, be truly <lb/>Tanned, or reduced to a limber sort of Leather; whereby <lb/>also the Weftage of
                    the fibers, or other mechanisme of the <lb/>Muscules might more easily and leisurely be observed. For <lb/>the skins of Beasts,
                    whereof Leather is daily made, are <lb/>Muscular; and in mans body consisteth, for the most part, <lb/>of the same carneous fibers,
                    as the Muscules, but more <lb/>closely woven or matted together.</p>

                  <p>The <rs type="object">SCELETON</rs> of a Woman; of equal height <lb/>with the former.

                        <name type="person" ref="1016" rend="italic">Bartholine</name>
                     </bibl>
                    and others have also <lb/>observed by the like comparison. I add, That the same <lb/>Bone is also broader by ½ an Inch in the
                    Female Sceleton, <lb/>than in the Male: <hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. for the better sustentation of the <lb/>
                     <hi rend="italic">Fœtus</hi> in the Womb. Again, That the <hi rend="italic">Os Sacrum</hi> is half <lb/>an Inch longer in the Female:
                    both for the forementioned <lb/>reason, and also the better proportion of the Parts. On <lb/>the contrary, That the <hi rend="italic">Vertebræ</hi>, especially of the <hi rend="italic">Loyns</hi>, <lb/>are much broader, thicker, and
                    stronger in the Male Scele<lb break="no"/>ton, than in the Female; being hereby better fitted for the <lb/>bearing of burthens. And, that as in
                    the Male Sceleton <lb/>there are 32 Teeth, as is usual, and in the Female but 28; <lb/>So the nether Chap in the Male Sceleton is
                    half an Inch <lb/>broader than in the Female, as being made to accom<lb break="no"/>modate a bigger Muscule for the motion of those <pb n="6"/>Teeth. And
                    for the same reason, the Angles subjected <lb/>to the <hi rend="italic">Os Jugale</hi> are above ½ an Inch more distant;
                    For <lb/>that a Man being fitted, in other respects, to undergo <lb/>more labour; his Chaps also should be the better made <lb/>to eat
                    the more. Once more, That the Skull of the Male <lb/>Sceleton, is much bigger, than of the Female; and so ca<lb break="no"/>pable of more
                    Brains. Although a little House may be <lb/>well furnished, and look better than a great one that stands <lb/>empty. </p>
                  <p>The <rs type="object">SCELETON</rs> of an Abortive Humane <hi rend="italic">Fœtus</hi>. <lb/>'Tis not above two Inches long. The parts of the
                    Head, <lb/>Chest, and Limbs are all entire, but not perfect. For the <lb/>extremities of the Bones of the Arms and Leggs, are at
                    <lb/>both ends plainly cartilagineous. They are in thickness <lb/>like a Taylors stitching Thread. Given by <name type="person" ref="955" rend="italic">Thomas Povey</name>

                  <p>It may possibly be conceived by some, That the Bones, <lb/>at least some of them, are hard at the first; as Salts and <lb/>other
                    like Crystallizing Bodies are as hard upon the very <lb/>first instant of their shooting, as they are when grown into <lb/>great
                    Crystals. But it is so far evident, that all the Bones <lb/>are soft at the first, that I am of opinion, That originally <lb/>they
                    are a <hi rend="italic">Congeries</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Fibers</hi> or fibrous Vessels, as true as <lb/>any other in the
                    Body; which by degrees harden into <lb/>Bones: even as the inmost Vessels in a Plant, do in time <lb/>harden into Wood. <note type="orig">
                        <bibl>See the Authors Anatomy of Plants</bibl>.</note> And that as in a Plant, there are <lb/>successive
                    additions of Rings or Tubes of Wood, made <lb/>out of Vessels: So in an Animal, it seems plain, That <lb/>there are additions
                    successively made to the Bones out of <lb/>the Fibrous parts of the Muscules; especially, those whitest <lb/>Fibers which run
                    transversly, and make the stamen or warp <lb/>of every Muscule. So that as in the <hi rend="italic">Barque</hi> of a Plant,
                    <lb/>part of the Vessels are successively derived outward to the <lb/>
                     <hi rend="italic">Rind</hi>, and part inward to the <hi rend="italic">Sap</hi>, which afterwards be<lb break="no"/>comes <hi rend="italic">hard wood</hi>. <note type="orig">

                    <p>From his Nose end to his Tail, a yard and ½ a foot long. <lb/>His Head above ½ a foot. His Neck ¼ of a

                        Grey-Hound. His Ears <lb/>like a <hi rend="italic">Coneys</hi>, about three inches long, and erect. As also <lb/>his Tail or
                        Scut, which exceeds not two inches. His fore-<lb/>Leg a foot and two inches long, taking in Foot and Thigh. <lb/>Near an inch
                        over: the Foot deeply cloven; with two <lb/>fore-Hoofs, an inch and ¼ long, each ¼ of an inch over; and <lb/>two
                        Heels, almost as big, and therefore conspicuous. His <lb/>hinder feet are here wanting. </p>
                    <p>His hair on his Head and Legs about ½ inch long, and <lb/>rateably small. On his Belly an inch and ½ long,
                        and some<lb break="no"/>what thicker. On his Back and Buttocks three inches long: <lb/>thicker in proportion, than in any other Animal,
                        except <lb/>perhaps some of the Deer kind, <hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. three or four times as <lb/>thick as Hogs Bristles:
                        consisting of brown and white porti<lb break="no"/>ons alternately from the Root to the top. On the Head and <lb/>Legs, brown; On the Belly
                        and under the Skut, whitish. As <lb/>it were frizled, especially on the Back and Belly, by a kind of <lb/>undulation. Softer
                        than in most Animals, and exceeding <lb/>light and rare. For being split, and view'd with a Glass, <lb/>they appear to be made
                        up of little Bladders, like those in <lb/>the Plume or Stalk of a Quill: so that it is a thing betwixt <lb/>a common Hair and a
                        Quill. On each side his lower <lb/>Chap, almost under the corners of his mouth, there is a <lb/>peculiar Tuft (about ¾ of
                        an inch long) of short, thick and <lb/>hard hairs, or rather Bristles, of equal length, as in a scrub<lb break="no"/>ing-Brush. </p>
                    <p>The Musk Bladder or Bag is about three inches long,<pb n="23"/> two over, and swelling out from his Belly one and ½.
                        <lb/>Standing before his Groin about as much. I find it cut <lb/>open, whereby the observation of its natural Aper<lb break="no"/>ture (which I
                        suppose it hath as the Castor-Bag) is pre<lb break="no"/>vented. </p>
                    <p>He hath 26 Teeth. In his lower Chap, sixteen; of which <lb/>there are eight little Cuters before; behind, four Grinders <lb/>on
                        each side, rugged and continuous. As many like Grin<lb break="no"/>ders in the upper Jaw. About an inch and ½ from the <lb/>Nose
                        end, in the same Jaw, on each side a Tusk, two <lb/>inches and ½ long, hooked downward, and backward, and <lb/>ending in
                        a point. Not round, but flat, the breadth of ½ <lb/>an inch; thin, and having a sharp edge behind: so as <lb/>it may not
                        unfitly be liken'd to a Sithe. There are no <lb/>Horns. </p>
                    <p>The Hair of this Animal, by its softness and rarity, are <lb/>a singular contrivance of Nature to keep him warm. For <lb/>all
                        Garments, the softer and rarer they are, (<hi rend="italic">cæt. par</hi>.) they <lb/>are the warmer. For the same
                        cause, the Hair on his Back, <lb/>is also the longest; <hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. for the better protection of the <hi rend="italic">Spi<lb break="no"/>nalis Medulla</hi>, His two Tusks, by the Figure, appear to <lb/>serve for fighting partly, and partly
                        for feeding; by the <lb/>help whereof he is able either to stub up edible Roots out <lb/>of the ground, or to tear off the
                        Barques, or break down <lb/>the Boughs of Trees. By the help of his great Ears, he hears <lb/>his approaching enemy the further
                        off, to make his flight. <lb/>So also the <hi rend="italic">Hare</hi>, being a fearful Animal, hath the like. <lb/>Nature hath
                        furnished him with great heels, both to en<lb break="no"/>able him to make the greater leaps, and to light also upon <lb/>his Feet the more
                        safely, for by their means, the force of <lb/>his weight is gradually broken. </p>

                        <lb/>notched, as it were, with transvers Incisions. Those near <lb/>the Margines and on the sides are composed into several
                        <lb/>Pyramidal <hi rend="italic">Area's</hi>, or great Triangles, whose Bases are about <lb/>two inches broad. On the Back, into
                        sexangular ones, each <lb/>of them convex. On the sides, and quite behind, the Shell <lb/>is carry'd somewhat inward. Before,
                        and hinderly, the <lb/>edges are toothed, and bended outward and upward. The <lb/>inward edges are cover'd with shelly Plates
                        above an inch <lb/>and ½ broad. </p>
                    <p>The Concave is composed of six and forty Bones. <lb/>Along the middle of the Back, are twelve, all, except the <lb/>foremost and
                        the four last, almost square. Next to these, <lb/>are eight on each side, like to so many contiguous Ribs; <lb/>together with
                        two lesser square Bones before: Next to these, <lb/>eight more, as it were, under-Ribs, on each side. To the <lb/>twelve
                        middlemost Bones, the Ribs are joyned by an al<lb break="no"/>ternate commissure, so as one of them answers to the halfs <lb/>of two Ribs,
                        <hi rend="italic">&amp; vice versa</hi>. To these, the under-Ribs, in <lb/>a wonderful manner,
                        <!-- scil meaning? --><hi rend="italic">scil</hi>. by a branched Suture or Inden<lb break="no"/>ture. For the great Teeth of the

                        out of the sides of the <lb/>great ones. The Belly-piece is here wanting. </p>
                    <p>Besides the most elegant ordering of the Work in the <lb/>Convex, there are three-things chiefly observable, which <lb/>serve
                        for the greater strength of the Shell. That is to say, <lb/>The <hi rend="italic">Convexity</hi> of the several <hi rend="italic">Area's</hi> on the Back, the<pb n="37"/> 
                        <hi rend="italic">branched Sutures</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Alternate commissures</hi> of the Bones. <lb/>Answerable to the Rule of Nature, in a <hi rend="italic">Humane

                    <p>Amongst other things worthy of note, the senselesness <lb/>of the tradition of the <hi rend="italic">Crocodiles</hi> moving

                    <p>The first Author of it was <name type="person" ref="149" rend="italic">Aristotle</name>, in his Fourth Book <lb/>

                        but of all others, which have a <lb/>long Head, and a wide <hi rend="italic">Rictus</hi>, that when they open their <lb/>Mouths,
                        they seem to move both Jaws; as both the <hi rend="italic">Viper</hi>, <lb/>and the <hi rend="italic">Lizard</hi>. And for

                    <p>The Figure of each Beak, is truly Hyperbolical. The <lb/>upper is ridged behind; before, plain or flat, pointed like a

                    <p>'Tis black; from the corners of his Mouth four inches <lb/>and ½ long. But the Horns, or horny portions, whereof <lb/>it
                        chiefly consists, are shorter; in the upper Beak, a little <lb/>more than three inches long; in the nether, two. Again, <lb/>in
                        the upper, it is obliquely prolonged from the Margins <lb/>to the Forehead; contrariwise, in the nether, it is ob<lb break="no"/>liquely
                        shorten'd from the Margins to that part under the <lb/>Tongue. The upper Beak is an inch high, between the <lb/>corners of the
                        Mouth as wide, but presently rises up into <lb/>a sharp Ridge. Its Edges about the middle, a little con<lb break="no"/>vex; about the end,
                        concave and sharp. They are double <lb/>Grooved, <hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. before and behind. In the end, 'tis crooked.
                        <lb/>The nether Beak behind as much over, as the upper; <lb/>towards the end, more compressed. Hollow like a Trough. <lb/>Its edges
                        sharp, and convex before; behind, they are groov'd. <lb/>In the middle, it bunches out underneath. The upper Beak, <lb/>is cut
                        with seven or eight oblique and crooked Notches; <lb/>the nether, with as many strait ones. </p>
                    <p>The height of the upper Beak; the sharpness, and the <lb/>extuberance of the lower; together with the grooved<pb n="72"/> Edges of
                        both, do all give the Bill a sure hold, and won<lb break="no"/>derful strength. The three Grooves, as so many Joynts, <lb/>keep the Beaks
                        from distortion, when in case of missing <lb/>the Prey, they are swifty and forceably clapt together. <lb/>The sharp Edges of
                        the nether Beak, serve instead of Teeth. <lb/>The Bunch underneath, answers<!-- ? -->W in some measure, to the <lb/>strength of
                        an Arch. The hight of the upper Beak, to that <lb/>of a Board, when set upon its Edge. </p>

Besides, al<lb break="no"/>though the upper Beak of this Bill, doth much resemble <lb/>that of the <hi rend="italic">Dodo</hi>; yet the nether is of a quite different <lb/>shape.

                    <p>The <rs type="object">SKULL</rs> is four inches long; the Bill, seven; two <lb/>and ½ high; one and ½ broad. The upper Beak is
                        hollow. <lb/>Is composed of six Bones. The uppermost whereof is four <lb/>inches and ½ long, above ½ inch high,
                        and convex. The <lb/>middlemost on each side, also four inches long, and <lb/>about ⅛ of an inch high or thick. The
                        lowermost, above <lb/>five inches long, and ¼ high. Their Edges are furrow'd <lb/>with oblique and deep Grooves both
                        before and behind. <lb/>All these five Bones are resimated or bended upward, with <lb/>some resemblance to a Saddle. The sixth,
                        at the end of <lb/>the Beak, is a wonderful strong Bone, crooked exactly like <lb/>the Bill of a <hi rend="italic">Parret</hi>,
                        and hollow; by the bow, almost <lb/>three inches, and near an inch over. Its Edges are very <lb/>keen, and standing out with two
                        sharp or pointed Angles. <lb/>The Nostrils are ¼ of an inch long, and almost two inches<pb n="74"/> before the Eyes. The nether
                        Beak is composed of <lb/>three Bones. The two hinder, four inches long, near <lb/>an inch high, and bended answerably to those
                        of the up<lb break="no"/>per Beak. Their Edges are cut with deep Furrows. The <lb/>third, at the end of the Beak, is hollow, above an inch
                        <lb/>long, near as high. Its Edges very sharp, and hard, and <lb/>exceedingly convex or bended downward. Underneath, <lb/>a round and
                        sharp Pin grows out from it in a level towards <lb/>the Skull, near an inch and ½ long. It was brought from <lb/>the

                    <p>The shape of this Bill shews it to belong to a Bird of <lb/>Prey, and as is most likely, some great Sea-Fowl; which <lb/>I will
                        venture to call <hi rend="italic">The Great <name type="place" ref="463">Indian</name> Gull</hi>. The strength <lb/>of the
                        end of the upper Beak is remarkable: as also are the <lb/>sharp and hard Edges of the nether; and the Grooved <lb/>Edges of

                        <rs type="object">OF EGGS</rs>, there is here a considerable number: which <lb/>therefore I thought fit to put altogether in this <lb/>Chapter. Their
                        Figures, as they stand together, appear <lb/>the more various. For some are almost Sphærical or <lb/>Round as a Ball:
                        others, as the most, are more oblong. <lb/>Of these, some few are perfectly Oval, <hi rend="italic">i. e</hi>. with both
                        the <lb/>ends defined with two equal <hi rend="italic">Ellipses:</hi> but most are Conical, <lb/>or with one end sharper than
                        the other. Of these again, <lb/>most have their smaller end but Blunt; some few, very <lb/>sharp. Lastly, almost all both Blunt
                        and Sharp are Con<lb break="no"/>vexly Conical, <hi rend="italic">i. e</hi>. they are all along Convex, not only <lb/>

              both ends. </p>
                    <p>Their Colours are also various; as White, Pale, Livid, <lb/>Ash-colour, Blew, Brown, Green. Their Spots, and Speckles, <lb/>are
                        also Iron-colour'd, Red, Bay, Musk-colour, Black, &amp;c. <lb/>the Causes of all which, both Figures and Colours, were <lb/>no

                    <p>The <rs type="object">EGG</rs> of a <rs type="object">HEN</rs>, with a thick knob so growing <lb/>on its greater end, as to appear to have been originally <lb/>liquid. </p>
                    <p>The <rs type="object">EGG</rs> of a <rs type="object">SWAN</rs> with another within it. Given <lb/>by Sir <name type="person" ref="51" rend="italic">Thomas Brown</name>
                        of <name type="place" ref="286" rend="italic">Norwich</name>. Who hath also observed <lb/>the like both in <hi rend="italic">Hens</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Turkeys</hi>. The utmost seemeth to <lb/>be a little bigger than
                        ordinary, <hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. near five inches long <lb/>by its <hi rend="italic">Axis</hi>, and ten round about, or
                        three and ⅓ strait <lb/>over. In shape like a <hi rend="italic">Turkeys</hi>. The other which is in<lb break="no"/>cluded sticks
                        fast to the side of the greater; whether it <lb/>did so originally, as also whether both of them contained <lb/>White and Yelk,
                        is uncertain. It is of the same figure, <lb/>about four inches long, bigger than the biggest <hi rend="italic">Hens</hi>
                        Egg. <lb/>The Shell of the same hardness and thickness as that of the <lb/>greater. </p>
                    <p>'Tis plain, that the lesser Egg was first perfectly form'd.<pb n="79"/> But not being big enough to provoke the <hi rend="italic">Vterus</hi> to exclu<lb break="no"/>sion, new matter gather'd round about it for another <lb/>Egg: and was the more easily supplied,
                        because so little <lb/>spent upon the former. And it may be noted, That Na<lb break="no"/>ture is so intent upon finishing her Work, that
                        she may be <lb/>observ'd much oftener to over do, than under do: you <lb/>shall find twenty Eggs with two Yelks, or hear of
                        twenty <lb/>Animals with two Heads, for one that hath none. </p>
                    <p>From the Egg with the Lump at the greater end, it <lb/>seems also plain, That the Shells of Eggs, although as hard <lb/>as any
                        Animal Stones, yet are not bred, as those, out of <lb/>stony Parts visibly præexistent in liquor, and so cluster'd
                        <lb/>together: but out of a liquid substance, not much un<lb break="no"/>like to that which is separated by the Reins of Birds. </p>
                    <p>Of the figure of the Egg, it is observable, That it usu<lb break="no"/>ally answers to that of the Body or Trunk of the Bird to <lb/>which
                        it belongs: as the Fruit is longer or broader, an<lb break="no"/>swerable to a tall or spreading Tree. And as it is a Tran<lb break="no"/>script from
                        the Original; so it self an Original for the <lb/>next Copy. So those Birds that have a Rump and hinder <lb/>Parts more Oval and
                        spreading, as the <hi rend="italic">Duck</hi>; or more <lb/>Conical, as the <hi rend="italic">Dunghill-Hen</hi>; breed, and
                        are bred of Eggs <lb/>alike shaped, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. That so there may be sufficient, yet no <lb/>superfluous Room,
              or Matter, for the <hi rend="italic">Chick</hi>. </p>
                    <p>Of the Number of Eggs laid at one Breed, it is also <lb/>worth the noting, That Land-Fowl, and of these especi<lb break="no"/>ally, such as
                        are Domestick, and whereof there is conti<lb break="no"/>nually great destruction made, for the most part lay a <lb/>considerable number of
                        Eggs for one sitting. Whereas <lb/>some Sea-Fowls, (as <bibl n="1775">Mr. <name type="person" ref="6" rend="italic">Willughby</name>
                        </bibl> observes of the <hi rend="italic">Pen<lb break="no"/>guin</hi>, and some others) lay but one. Because
                        building <lb/>upon the Rocks, where they are seldomer destroy'd, were <lb/>they greater Breeders, there would not be room enough

                        Con<lb break="no"/>vulsions, and recover. It is also said in one of the Expe<lb break="no"/>riments, that the Dog which liv'd, vomited: and in the
                        <lb/>other, there is nothing said to the contrary. The question <lb/>therefore is, Whether many other things, which will cause
                        <lb/>vomiting, may not do as well, as this so much celebrated <lb/>Horn? </p>
                    <p>Whatever it may perform against Poison, it hath, saith <lb/>

              near its <hi rend="italic">Basis</hi>, two inches broad; at the fore-end,<pb n="85"/> one. Armed, on each side, with seven and
                        twenty Spikes, <lb/>each ½ an inch long, bended a little backward, and with <lb/>two sharp edges behind, as the Spur of
                        the <hi rend="italic">Unicorne</hi> Bird hath <lb/>above. </p>
                    <p>His Head very flat, about three inches long; behind, <lb/>almost four inches broad; before, two. His Eyes an inch <lb/>long, as
                        much behind the Snout, two inches distant. <lb/>Above ½ an inch behind his Eyes he hath two Spouts, about <lb/>¼
                        of an inch wide, by both which (as some Fishes by a <lb/>single one) he casts out the Water, which in taking the <lb/>Prey, or
                        otherwise, he receives into his mouth. Beneath, <lb/>close by the Root of the Saw, are two oblique Nostrils, an <lb/>inch
                        distant, figur'd like the letter S. An inch behind these, <lb/>his Mouth, two inches and ½ over. His Lips are rugged

                    <p>The Apertures of his Gills are five; placed obliquely, <lb/>not on his sides, but his Breast, about four inches behind <lb/>his
              Mouth. </p>
                    <p>His Trunk or Body presently behind his Head, becomes <lb/>fives inches broad, and about three high; from whence it <lb/>is again
              extenuated all the way to the end of his Tail. </p>
                    <p>He hath seven triangular Finns. On the bottom of his <lb/>sides, two Gill-Finns, not behind the Gills, as in most <lb/>Fishes,
                        but for a good part before them; near eight inches <lb/>long, above three broad, and almost horizontal. Three <lb/>inches behind
                        these, two Belly-Finns, two inches broad, <lb/>five long, and as much distant. Directly over these, on <lb/>the Back a fifth,
                        four inches long, above three high. On <lb/>the Back also, but near the Tail, a sixth, four inches long, <lb/>and as high. The
                        Tail-Finn, as it were half a Finn, being <lb/>½ a foot high, but underneath level with the Tail. </p>
                    <p>Cover'd all over with a tough and dark-colour'd Skin, <lb/>somewhat rough, as you draw your hand forward: from <lb/>the
                        Belly-Finns to the end of the Tail, as it were pinched <lb/>together into a little Ridge on each side. There are many <lb/>of

                    <p>The reason why he hath two Spouts, seemeth to be the <lb/>flatness and breadth of his Head or Mouth; in which the <lb/>Water
                        lying more spread, could not so expeditely be <lb/>carri'd off by a single one in the middle, as by one on each <lb/>side. </p>

                    <p>He is said to defend himself from the <hi rend="italic">Whale</hi> with his <lb/>Saw. Wherewith, by its structure, 'tis
                        plain, that he fetches <lb/>his stroak backward or side-ways, the Spikes being bended, <lb/>pointed, and edged, and so made to
                        prick and cut, that <lb/>way. </p>

                        them <lb/>two inches and ½ long, and figur'd as above described. </p>
                    <p>The length of the Fish before described, from end to end, <lb/>if compar'd with the Saw is as four to one. Therefore the
                        <lb/>Fish, to which this Saw belong'd, was near five yards and <lb/>half long. Again, the number of Spikes in the Saw of the
                        <lb/>Fish now describ'd, compared with those in this great Saw, <lb/>is somewhat more than as three to two. Therefore had <lb/>the

                        leave to name it. 'Tis half <lb/>a yard long; near the Head, two inches over; about the <lb/>middle, one. Not with a flat point,
                        but one perfectly <lb/>round. The upper part hereof is smooth, the nether<pb n="87"/> rough, the smooth and rough parts continu'd

                        <lb/>which this Fish hath not. The nether Chap hath also a <lb/>different shape from that of the Rapier-Fish: this being <lb/>not
                        above four inches over, that half a foot; yet both <lb/>are a foot long. It is composed of two Bones, so joyned <lb/>together,

                    <p>The Sword grows in a level, not from the upper but <lb/>the under Jaw, from whence we may give the Fish his <lb/>Name. In length

                    <p>The Stomach remarkable, consisting of three Bags. The <lb/>Guts eleven times the length of the Fish. The Glands of <lb/>the

                        notice, That the whitish substance within every <lb/>Gland, and the same which is in the Kidneys of other <lb/>Animals, is truly

                    <p>'Tis a yard long. The Head ½ a foot long, and almost <lb/>as high; being compressed on the sides, three inches and
                        <lb/>½ over underneath, her Forehead but a little above two. <lb/>Her Snout a little Convex. The Eyes very high, an inch
                        <lb/>long. The Nostrils before the Eyes ¼ of an inch. Both <lb/>the Chaps blunt-angled before, from the Corners of <lb/>the
                        Mouth three inches long, between the Corners, as <lb/>much. </p>
                    <p>The Teeth all very thick, like those of <hi rend="italic">Quadrupedes</hi>; <lb/>both in figure and scituation, very
                        unusual. In the upper <lb/>Jaw, five before; not Incisors, or Cutters, but thick Pun<lb break="no"/>chers. To the Roots of which, within
                        side, grow as it <lb/>were nine little Teeth. Behind, are three Grinders; one<pb n="96"/> of which, on each side, is fasten'd obliquely
                        inwards, half an <lb/>inch broad, and above an inch long. The third, and the great<lb break="no"/>est, stands betwixt them in the middle of
                        the Palate. Each of <lb/>these having deep Incisions, seem, as it were, eight or ten <lb/>Teeth. In the under Jaw, are two
                        Punchers or Claviculars, <lb/>each of them having two sharp Processes within side. Be<lb break="no"/>hind, there seems to be only one
                        Grinder on each side, half <lb/>an inch broad, and above two inches long, arched inward, <lb/>and with sixteen or eighteen
                        Incisions looking like so many <lb/>Teeth. </p>
                    <p>Her Gills open almost from the top of her Head to her <lb/>Throat. The Fins are four. The Gill-Fins about five inches <lb/>long,
                        and as broad, placed so low, as to meet in the Breast, <lb/>and so to supply the Breast-Fins. The Back-Fin is extended <lb/>from
                        Head to Tail; before, an inch high; behind, above <lb/>two. The Belly-Fin reaches from the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi>
                        (which opens <lb/>a foot behind the Head) to the Tail, about an inch deep. <lb/>The Body, where highest, above ½ a foot,
                        the Back a little <lb/>convex, grows slender all the way to the Tail, the extre<lb break="no"/>mity whereof is here wanting. She is cover'd
                        with a tough <lb/>Skin, now of an Iron-colour, besprinkled all over with <lb/>round spots. </p>
                    <p>That which is most remarkable in this Fish, are his Teeth: <lb/>which are so made, as to be fit either for Ravine, or for
                        <lb/>the eating of Grass and other Herbs on the Rocks, and un<lb break="no"/>der Water. They seem also to be made for the Cracking <lb/>of

                        not full. And either the Fish he describes is a <lb/>different Species, or his Description of the Teeth is not <lb/>true. </p>
                    <p>This is above an Ell long. His Head about ¼ of a yard<pb n="97"/> long, and near as much over, (here) with several Angles
                        <lb/>or Ridges: His Mouth five inches over, his Lips almost <lb/>Semilunar. </p>
                    <p>Each of his Jaws are armed with about six and thirty <lb/>Rows of most sharp Teeth, and in every Row there are <lb/>four Teeth.
                        So that in all they are about two hundred four<lb break="no"/>score and eight, all couched a little inward. </p>
                    <p>About three inches behind his Nose-end stand his Eyes, <lb/>as it were on the top of his Head, and three inches and
                        ½ <lb/>distant. Proportionably very small, <hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. not above ½ an inch <lb/>over. About an inch
                        and quarter behind his Eyes, and a <lb/>little lower, he hath two Spouts, one on each side, above <lb/>an inch long, and convex
                        before. His Neck ½ a foot over. <lb/>His Back before, three inches above a foot, expanded (here) <lb/>on both sides, as
                        if it were shoulder'd. His Middle or Wast <lb/>about eight inches. The lower part of his Back, ten inches, <lb/>spread like a
                        pair of Buttocks. From his Shoulders to the <lb/>bottom of his Buttocks about a foot and ½. The length <lb/>of his Tail,
                        as much: the forepart whereof above four <lb/>inches over, growing slenderer all the way to the end. </p>
                    <p>He hath seven Fins. His Shoulder-Fins with Cartilagi<lb break="no"/>nous Rays, expanded ½ a foot out like a pair of Wings, and
                        <lb/>almost square. His Buttock-Fins prolonged hinderly ½ a <lb/>foot, stand continguous to the Tail on both sides. On
                        <lb/>the top of his Tail, two lesser; three inches high, and <lb/>couched backward. At the end a forked one ½ a foot
                        <lb/>long, and almost as high. From hence half a foot forward, <lb/>the Skin is as it were pinched up into a little Ridge or
                        <lb/>Doublet on each side. </p>
                    <p>Above he is very rough with innumerable small Prickles, <lb/>especially felt upon drawing your hand forward. And the <lb/>edges
                        of the four side-Fins are all thorny. But underneath <lb/>the Skin is so thick or closely cover'd with little hard round
                        <lb/>knobs, as it seems almost smooth. </p>
                    <p>This Fish hath two Spouts, like the Saw-Fish, because of <lb/>the breadth of his Head. His Teeth admirable for taking <lb/>sure
                        hold of the most slippery Prey. Those Doublets on <lb/>the sides of his Tail, seem to add strength to the <hi rend="italic">Muscules</hi> 
                        <lb/>which move the Tail-Fins. And so in some other Fishes. <lb/>By the posture of the Fins he seems to make

                        </bibl> is not full. This Head <lb/>is
                        ½ a foot long, as broad, and half as high. The Snout flat. <lb/>Both the Chaps before of a <hi rend="italic">Semilunar</hi> figure. Armed with <lb/>an innumerable company of prickly Teeth, standing like <lb/>those in a <hi rend="italic">Card</hi> wherewith Women Comb Wooll. The <lb/>nether Chap stands out above an inch before the upper. <lb/>The
                        Eyes round, and for such a Head, very small, scarce the <lb/>third of an inch over. Distant three inches and ½. An
                        <lb/>inch above the corners of his Mouth, he hath two strings, <lb/>smooth and round, here (for they are broken) ½ a foot
                        <lb/>long, about the thickness of an <hi rend="italic">Earth-Worm</hi>, taper'd and <lb/>bended backward; outwardly nervous,
                        inwardly Cartila<lb break="no"/>ginous or Grisly. His Gills descending almost from the <lb/>top of his Head, meet under his Throat. </p>
                    <p>What may be the use of these strings is uncertain, and <lb/>to be collected only from observing their communication <lb/>with
                        other parts, and the manners of the Fish. But the<pb n="104"/> intent of their structure is less obscure; the Nervous part <lb/>serving
                        to draw it too and fro; the Cartilage, as the spring <lb/>in a <hi rend="italic">Pendulum</hi> Watch, to stint the motion
                        and make it more <lb/>steady. And being flexible, it dœs the same as a joynted <lb/>Series of many little Bones. </p>

                    <p>'Tis ½ a yard long, almost ¼ high, with its sides very much <lb/>compressed, being not above two inches and a
                        ½ over. <lb/>High-Bac'd, like a <hi rend="italic">Perch</hi>. And also (which is unusual) <lb/>bow-Belli'd. His Head hath
                        some resemblance to that of <lb/>a <hi rend="italic">Baboone</hi>; from the top to the bottom four inches and ½. <lb/>His
                        Mouth, which stands below, not much above an inch <lb/>over. His Teeth, in both Chaps, the thickness of a midling <lb/>Needle,
                        the eight of an inch long. His Gills subtended <lb/>to his Eyes and Mouth like the segment of a Circle. His <lb/>Eyes stand near
                        the top of his Head; and are an inch <lb/>over. </p>
                    <p>From the top is prolonged a smooth (now) blackish, <lb/>round, taper'd, strait Horn, couched a little down below <lb/>the level,
                        two inches round about the Root, and three <lb/>inches long. It seemeth not to have any Bone within it; <lb/>nor is it inserted
                        into any, as in the <hi rend="italic">Unicorne</hi> of the Cetace<lb break="no"/>ous kind before described; but is the Skin it self
                        prolonged <lb/>and hardened (as the <hi rend="italic">Cuticula</hi> turns to <hi rend="italic">Cornes</hi>) into a kind <lb/>of
              horn. </p>
                    <p>The Fins are seven. The Gill-Fins two inches long, and <lb/>one broad. The Back-Fin is extended from Head to Tail, <lb/>above an
                        inch and ½ high. The Breast-Fins ¼ of an inch <lb/>before the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi>, near two inches
                        long. The Belly-Fin, <lb/>like that of the Back, and extended from the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi> to the end <lb/>of the Tail.
                        That at the end of the Tail <hi rend="italic">triangular</hi>, two <lb/>inches and ½ long, three high. The <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi>, if you measure <lb/>by a perpendicular from the Gills, opens, oddly, not above <lb/>an inch and
                        ½ behind them. He is cover'd with a (now) <lb/>blackish, thick and tough Skin, and when you draw your <lb/>hand forward,
              also rough. </p>

But I meet with no <lb/>tolerable Description any where. </p>
                    <p>'Tis about ¼ of a yard long. His Body before, three <lb/>inches and ½ over; thence tapering to the Tail-end.
                        His <lb/>Mouth two inches and ½ over. His Chaps ending some<lb break="no"/>what angularly. The nether a little broader, and produced
                        <lb/>forward near an inch more than the upper. His Lips rough <lb/>with a great number of little prickles. His Eyes round,
                        <lb/>¼ of an inch over, an inch behind his Mouth. </p>
                    <p>His Head squat, adorned with a kind of Oval <hi rend="italic">Coronet</hi>, <lb/>somewhat Concave, five inches and ½
                        long, above two broad, <lb/>cut traversly with three and twenty Incisions or long <lb/>Apertures, making so many distinct
                        Membranes, with <lb/>rough edges, joyned altogether with a Ligament running <lb/>through the middle of the <hi rend="italic">Coronet</hi>, and perforated on each <lb/>side the Ligament. </p>
                    <p>The Gills wind from an inch and ½ behind the Eyes down <lb/>to the Throat. The Fins seven. The Gill-Fins above <lb/>four
                        inches long; The Breast-Fins as long. About a ¼ of <lb/>a yard behind the <hi rend="italic">Coronet</hi> a fifth
                        extended on the Back <lb/>above ¼ of a yard. A sixth like it on the Belly. The <lb/>Tail-end, like a Spear, a little
                        compressed. The Tail-Fin <lb/>three inches and ½ long. The <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi> open about the middle <lb/>of the
                        Fish. His Skin is (now) brown, smooth, and tough, <lb/>or like tan'd Leather. </p>

                    <p>The Gills but ¼ of an inch long, Convex before, very <lb/>high, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. in the same level with
                        the Eye. As also the Gill-<lb/>Fins, which are about two inches long, and three broad. <lb/>Two inches and ½ before the

                    <p>He is cover'd with a Skin on the Back (now) of a <lb/>brownish yellow, on the Belly whitish. Armed all round <lb/>about,

                    <p>'Tis most probable, That to these Roots are fasten'd <lb/>so many <hi rend="italic">Muscules</hi>, whereby these little

                    <p>This is seven inches long, three broad, and as high. <lb/>His Forehead above an inch and ½ over, by the eminency<pb n="108"/> of
                        his Eye-Brows a little hollow. His Eyes round, above <lb/>½ an inch over. His Mouth very broad and semilunar, like

                        forward than the <lb/>upper. Without any Teeth, but rough like a File. The <lb/>Gills ½ an inch long, an inch and
                        ¼ behind the Eyes. The <lb/>Fins are five. The Gill-Fins above an inch long, almost as <lb/>broad. Before the end of the

                    <p>He is cover'd all over with a very hard and tough Skin, <lb/>(now) of a yellowish straw-colour. Armed round about <lb/>with

                    <p>It may further be noted of these Spikes, That being fixed <lb/>in the Skin, both here and in the other kinds, so as to
                        couch <lb/>and point backward, the fish needs not to tack about, but is <lb/>at the same time in a posture of defence, and of

                        <lb/>I call it the <hi rend="italic">File-Fish</hi>, from the likeness which the foremost <lb/>Bone upon his Back hath to a file. There are three of them:

                        stir: but if you depress the last and least of all never <lb/>so softly, the other two immediately fall down with it: <lb/>just

                    <p>His Wings, saith the <name type="person" ref="860">same Author</name>, are longer than his <lb/>Body. Whereby it appears,
                        that he did not take notice, That <lb/>this Animal hath four Wings, whereof the uppermost pair <lb/>are not above ¾ of an
                        inch long. The other indeed are <lb/>prolonged above ¼ of an inch beyond the Tail. Each of <lb/>these apart is most

                        <lb/>Their being thus folded up, is a contrivance to secure <lb/>them from being torn, as he runs to and fro under <lb/>ground. </p>

                    <p>The <rs type="object">COCO</rs>-<rs type="object">NUT</rs>. The Fruit of a very tall Tree, <lb/>both in the <name type="place" ref="136" rend="italic">East</name> and

                        Writers of Natural History, <lb/>but not by any one distinctly describ'd. As by one sent <lb/>me fresh by Mr. <name type="person" ref="1912" rend="italic">Sam. Moody</name> from <name type="place" ref="141" rend="italic">Jamaica</name>, I
                        had the op<lb break="no"/>portunity to observe. Here are three of them entire. The <lb/>bigest whereof is about a foot in length, and one
                        and ¾ in <lb/>compass. With three sides, one whereof more flat; bel<lb break="no"/>ly'd in the middle, and somewhat Conick at both
                        ends; <lb/>so that it is a kind of Sphærical Triangle. The Husk or <lb/>outmost part of the Nut on the sides, about an
                        inch thick; <lb/>at the Corners, an inch and ½; almost wholly consisting of <lb/>tough woody <hi rend="italic">Fibers</hi>; so that being cut <hi rend="italic">transversly</hi>, it looks <lb/>like a stiff <hi rend="italic">Scrubbing-Brush</hi>. Next within this <hi rend="italic">Fibrous</hi> Part, <lb/>lies the Shell, brown, hard, and
                        brittle, like a <hi rend="italic">Plum-Stone</hi>; <lb/>the ⅕ of an inch in thickness; about three inches Diametre,
                        <lb/>and of an Oval Figure, not much unlike that of an<pb n="198"/> 
                        <hi rend="italic">Ostriches</hi>, or sometimes a <hi rend="italic">Cassowarys-Egg</hi>. Yet so, as <lb/>always to be <hi rend="italic">Trivalvous, i. e</hi>. composed of three Sides or

                        At the <hi rend="italic">Base</hi> of the said Shell, are always like<lb break="no"/>wise three conspicuous Holes, by which originally
                        are ad<lb break="no"/>mitted a considerable number of <hi rend="italic">Fibers</hi> into the Concave <lb/>of the Shell. Next within the

                    <p>For the more easie and convenient eruption of the <hi rend="italic">Radi<lb break="no"/>cle</hi>, the Shell is not one entire piece,
                        but divided into <lb/>three (as are most Seed-Covers into two or more) distinct <lb/>Plates; which gradually cleave asunder, to

                    <p>Two more <rs type="object">LONG COCO</rs>-<rs type="object">NUTS</rs>, somewhat less than <lb/>that now describ'd. </p>

                    <p>An <rs type="object">ORBICULAR COCO</rs>-<rs type="object">SHELL</rs>; four inches and ¼ <lb/>long, and as much in Diametre. </p>
                    <p>Another Great <rs type="object">ORBICULAR</rs> one. 'Tis a foot and ¾ <lb/>in compass. A <hi rend="italic">Coco-Nut</hi> of a foot and

                    <p>The <rs type="object">COCO</rs> is one of the most useful Trees in the <lb/>World. Of the Husk or outmost fibrous Cover of the <lb/>Nut, all manner of

                        <name type="place" ref="110" rend="italic">India</name>. Of the Shells, the <name type="place" ref="110" rend="italic">Indians</name> make Ladles, Wine-Bot<lb break="no"/>tles, and many sorts of Vessels. The
                        inmost Cover next <lb/>the <hi rend="italic">Kernel</hi>, while it contains only Liquor, they eat with salt, <lb/>as a very
                        pleasant meat. The said Liquor, is commonly <lb/>used, as a clear sweet and cool Drink. Sometimes they cut <lb/>away the Blossom
                        of the young <hi rend="italic">Nut</hi>, and binding a con<lb break="no"/>venient Vessel to the place, thereby obtain a sweet and
                        <lb/>pleasant Liquor, which they call <hi rend="italic">Sura</hi>. This standing an <lb/>hour in the Sun, becomes good <hi rend="italic">Vinegar</hi>, used throughout <lb/>
                        <name type="place" ref="110" rend="italic">India</name>. The same

                        <lb/>press out a Milk, which they always mix and eat with <lb/>their <hi rend="italic">Rice-Meats</hi>. Of the <hi rend="italic">Kernel</hi> dry'd (called <hi rend="italic">Copra</hi>) and <lb/>stamped, they make Oil, both to eat, and to burn. Of

                        to the height of six or eight feet; <lb/>and is joynted like a Cane. 'Tis also full of a sweet juyce <lb/>like that of the
                        Sugar-Cane. On the Spike grow several <lb/>strong thick Husks, which, before it is ripe, shut it close up <lb/>round about.
                        Thereby defending it, not only from all <lb/>Weathers, but also the Ravine of Birds, to which, the Corn, <lb/>while tender, is a
              sweet and enticing food. </p>
                    <p>The Stalks of this Corn, are good Fodder for Cattel. <lb/>As are also the Husks about the Spike. The <name type="place" ref="101">Indian</name> Women <lb/>slit the
                        Husks, and weave them into Baskets of several <lb/>fashions. Of the Juyce above-said may be made a Syrup <lb/>as sweet as Sugar:
                        which probably, may also be made <lb/>of it, by the usual method. The <name type="place" ref="101" rend="italic">Indians</name> eat
                        the ripe <lb/>Corn either boil'd; or more usually parched; of it self, or, <lb/>as Bread, with Flesh. The green Corn also,
                        which, as is <lb/>said, hath a sweet Tast, being boil'd, dry'd, and kept in <lb/>Bags, and when they eat it, boil'd again, they
                        account a <lb/>principal Dish. The <name type="place" ref="22" rend="italic">English</name>, of the ripe Corn, make very
                        <lb/>good Bread: but it must be mixed nothing near so stiff as <lb/>our Wheat-Meal. But the best sort of Food made hereof; <lb/>they

                            much. For a <hi rend="italic">Sponge</hi> being a springy Body, and so <lb/>extensible, and yielding a little to one
                            that plucks at it; so <lb/>soon as he lets his hold go, it will, from its elasticity, shrink <lb/>up again. Which motion of
                            restitution, some probably, <lb/>have mistaken for the effect of <del resp="errata">a Cap-</del>Sense. </p>
                        <p>No <hi rend="italic">Sponge</hi> hath any Lignous Fibers, but is wholly com<lb break="no"/>pressed of those which make the Pith
                            and all the pithy parts <lb/>of a Plant. Yet vastly thicker, and their Texture much <lb/>more rare or open, so as to be
                            visible to a good eye, espe<lb break="no"/>cially assisted with an ordinary Glass. So that a <hi rend="italic">Sponge</hi>, in

                        <rs type="object">IT</rs> hath been much disputed, and is not yet resolv'd, of <lb/>many subterraneal Bodies, which have the semblance <lb/>of <hi rend="italic">Animals</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Parts</hi> of them, Whether they were ever <lb/>such, or no. And I am
                        not ignorant of the Arguments <lb/>offer'd on both hands. If I may speak my own sense a <lb/>little, Why not? Is there any thing
                        repugnant in the <lb/>matter? Why not a petrify'd Shell, as well as wood? Or <lb/>is the place? If Shells are found under
                        ground, far from <lb/>Sea, or in Hills, unchanged; as we are sure they are; then <lb/>why not petrify'd? Or is the form, to

                        <lb/>of Shells doth answer? The assertion is precarious: no <lb/>man can say, how many
                        are known to some one or other; <lb/>much less, how many are not known: I have reason to <lb/>believe, that scarce the one half
                        of the under <hi rend="italic">Species</hi> of <lb/>Shells are known to this day. And so for <hi rend="italic">Artisicials:</hi> if <lb/>

                        Pictures, and other Works, in time petri<lb break="no"/>fy'd? And although Nature doth often imitate her self; <lb/>yet to make her in any
                        case to imitate Art, is unphiloso<lb break="no"/>phical and absurd: for the one, a natural reason may be <lb/>given, not for the other. </p>
                     <pb n="254"/>
                    <p>On the other side: although Nature cannot be said to <lb/>imitate Art: yet it may fall out, that the effects of both <lb/>may
                        have some likeness. Those white Concretions which the <lb/>

                    <p>This <hi rend="italic">Jaw-Bone</hi>, is only part of the far Cheek; about <lb/>fifteen inches long, and seven where
                        deepest: yet part of <lb/>both the ends, and the <hi rend="italic">Sockets</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Teeth</hi> are
                        broken off. <lb/>The <hi rend="italic">Orbit</hi> of the Eye, neither so round, nor so big, as in <lb/>the <hi rend="italic">Hippopotamus:</hi> yet the <hi rend="italic">Teeth</hi> far bigger. For the bigest <lb/>

                        in the Head of the <hi rend="italic">Hippopotamus</hi> here preserv'd, is <lb/>less than six inches about: one of these,
                        near eight. And <lb/>'tis much, if they belonged to that Animal, that none of <lb/>the long Cutters which grow before (as is

                        stands higher than the Eye. The Knob <lb/>also at the Corner of the Eye in this Bone, is six times as <lb/>big, as in the said

                        <rs type="object">PLATED MARBLE</rs>. It seems to have been originally a <lb/>striated Bole. Now a Stone as hard as Marble, composed <lb/>of Portions,

                        for the space of some Weeks. Then, returning to <lb/>it, and applying more weight to the former, it very easily <lb/>held the

                        That his Stone had not only recovered its former <lb/>strength, but encreas'd it; for whereas before he had never <lb/>known it
                        to take up more than sixteen, it would now take <lb/>up twenty times its own weight. And he is now continuing <lb/>the

                            at the bottom of the Boyler, and <lb/>of the Boyler it self. Sometimes, in stirring the Earth on <lb/>the Beds, they find

                            con<lb break="no"/>cerning the same, which I purpose to publish ere long. I <lb/>shall here only Note, that although Many think and
                            affirm, <lb/>That all the Fixed Salts of Vegetables are alike: yet by These, <lb/>duly managed, it doth appear, That there
                            is a great diffe<lb break="no"/>rence, both as to strength, and otherwise, between divers <lb/>of them, even when they have been
                            equally calcin'd. So <lb/>far, that the promiscuous use of some of them, in Physick, is<pb n="353"/> unsafe: as, for instance, of
                            <hi rend="italic">Tartar</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Wormwood</hi>; half a <lb/>Scruple of the former, being as

                  much as mention the Materials. </p>
                        <p>I call it <hi rend="italic">Solid</hi>, to distinguish it from two Liquid kinds. <lb/>The Author of one, supposed to be

In whose <hi rend="italic">Laboratory</hi>, the <lb/>solid kind was also made by his direction,
                  several ways. </p>
                  <p>Of the Process for This here, Dr. <name type="person" ref="1149" rend="italic">Slare</name> some years since
                  <lb/>received a hint from Dr. <hi rend="italic">
                        <name type="person" ref="1855">Christian Connerding</name>, Archiater</hi> to <lb/>the
                  <name type="person" ref="1943">Duke of <name type="place" ref="1364" rend="italic">Zell</name>.</name> And not hearing of any one, amongst <lb/>many that have try'd,
                  besides these Three, to have suc<lb break="no"/>ceeded in the making of it, he hath imparted the following <lb/>Account. </p>
                        <p>Take good firm <hi rend="italic">Chalk</hi>, ignite it in a <hi rend="italic">Crucible</hi>, and then <lb/>powder it.
                            Put into a pint or half a pint of strong <hi rend="italic">Spirit of <lb/>Nitre, Cochleatim</hi>, as much hereof, as
                            will serve well to sati<lb break="no"/>ate it, <hi rend="italic">i. e</hi>. till it becomes sweetish, and makes no <hi rend="italic">Effervescence</hi> 
                     <lb/>upon the injection of the <hi rend="italic">Chalk</hi>. Then dilute this
                            Liquor <lb/>with fair Water, filtre it through a Paper, and so evaporate <lb/>it in a large Glass, or glazed Vessel, or good
                            <hi rend="italic">Hassian Crucible</hi> 
                     <lb/>to a dry <hi rend="italic">Salt</hi>. The preparation whereof may be
                            perform'd <lb/>in four hours: whereas I have seen a <choice>
                        <sic>Pocess</sic>
                        <corr>Process</corr>
                     </choice>, that would
                            take <lb/>as many Weeks to follow it. </p>
                        <p>The main business lies in the good <hi rend="italic">Enchiresis</hi>; about <lb/>which these several Directions must be
                            carefully ob<lb break="no"/>serv'd. </p>
                        <p>First you must prepare a Vessel of Clay, somewhat like <lb/>a shallow <hi rend="italic">Coffee-Dish</hi>, of three,
                            four, or five inches in Dia<lb break="no"/>metre, and an inch in depth, very well baked and neal'd. <lb/>Then place it under a Muffle,
                            after the manner of a Refining <lb/>Furnace, in the place where the Cuppels usually stand: and <lb/>so make it red hot. Then
                            put the prepared <hi rend="italic">Salt</hi> into it, by <lb/>little and little, not above ʒj ss. or ʒij at a time. Keep the <lb/>fire to
                            that degree, which will suffice to make the <hi rend="italic">Salt</hi> boil <lb/>in the Dish, so as to spread it self
                            every way, and creep up <lb/>the sides of it. Before the <hi rend="italic">Salt</hi>, last put in, be consumed, be <lb/>sure
                            always to be ready, to make a new addition, otherwise <lb/>your labour so far is lost, and you must begin again.<pb n="355"/> When
                            five or six Drachms are fum'd away, take the Dish <lb/>nimbly out of the fire, so soon as the <hi rend="italic">Salt</hi> last put in is dry. <lb/>If you have wrought well, what remains in the Dish will <lb/>be yellowish in some
                            parts, and every yellow part will shine. <lb/>Secure this Matter from the Air by fitting and cementing <lb/>a Glass to it:
                            otherwise it will loose its property in one <lb/>Week. </p>
                  <p>As to the Cause of this strange <hi rend="italic">Phænomenon</hi>, Dr. <name type="person" ref="1149" rend="italic">Slare</name> 
                     <lb/>continues to this effect. I shall in short offer my Thoughts, <lb/>and refer them to
                  your Judgment. Two Questions may <lb/>arise: What it is in this Mixture that yields the light? and, <lb/>How it doth it? As
                  to the first, I take it to be the pure fiery <lb/>part of the <hi rend="italic">Spirit of Nitre</hi> embraced by the
                  <hi rend="italic">Chalk</hi>. For <lb/>that the rest is weak and phlegmatick; as appears, if it be <lb/>distill'd. Also,
                  that about the end of the Operation, a black <lb/>Fume begins to rise and fly away. That if by continuing <lb/>the Dish too
                  long in the fire, you drive all the Nitrous parts <lb/>away, the <hi rend="italic">Chalk</hi> which stays behind will
                  not be luminous. <lb/>Or if the Matter duly prepar'd, be exposed to the Air, and <lb/>thereby prey'd upon, the same effect
                  will follow. </p>
                        <p>As to the Second, I suppose, That it shines not by Imbi<lb break="no"/>bition of Light, but by Impression from it, from whence
                            <lb/>proceeds a motion therein productive of Light. Which <lb/>we may the rather be induced to believe, In that if it be <lb/>put
                            into an Iron Cover, and then an Iron Box, and a good <lb/>heat given to it, it will shine so vigorously as to seem to
                            <lb/>kindle the Air about it. That two Men by following their <lb/>blow close, will make a Bar of Iron glow, or shine in the
                            <lb/>dark. And although the Impulse of Light may seem small; <lb/>yet upon Bodies nearly related to it, as This seems to be,
                            it <lb/>appears to be great. As in those odd effects it sometimes <lb/>hath upon Infants unus'd to it; and People that have
                            sore <lb/>Eyes; or have been newly Couch'd; as it happen'd to <lb/>Dr. <name type="person" ref="1853" rend="italic">Castle</name>
                            sometime since, who by making bold with his <lb/>Eyes too early, (<hi rend="italic">i. e</hi>. by a too frequent
                            admission of light <lb/>to them,) after that Operation, did thereupon suffer such <lb/>extreme pains, and mischief in his
                            Eyes, that he now dispairs <lb/>of ever seeing more. </p>
                  <p>Mr. <name type="person" ref="1123" rend="italic">Haac</name>
                     <note type="orig">Author of the<bibl>
                          <hi rend="italic">Experiment upon the Loadstone</hi>, Part 3</bibl>.</note> saith he, hath frequently
                  repeated the <lb/>following Experiment upon this <hi rend="italic">Phosphorus</hi>. If it be ex<lb break="no"/>posed to the Morning
                  Light a little before Sun rising, it<pb n="356"/> presents a bright Rosy hugh. As the Sun approaches the <lb/>
                     <hi rend="italic">Meridian</hi>, it advances to a higher and more firey Com<lb break="no"/>plexion, like that of a red hot Iron. A little after
                  Sun-set, <lb/>declines to a pale wan colour, like <hi rend="italic">Chalk</hi>, or rather <hi rend="italic">Mother <lb/>of
                      Pearl</hi>. </p>
                        <p>Expos'd, saith he, to the light of a Candle, or flaming <lb/>Fagot, it receives a pale Luminous colour, as from the <lb/>Sun
                            towards setting. But being expos'd for a considerable <lb/>time to the most clear Moonshine that I have seen in <name type="place" ref="52" rend="italic">Lon<lb break="no"/>don</name>, I could not perceive it to become Luminous in the <lb/>least. </p>
                        <p>It hath been kept, saith he, in the <hi rend="italic">Vacuum</hi> of my Great <lb/>and Noble Patron, the Honourable Mr.
                            <name type="person" ref="1009" rend="italic">Boyle</name> called <hi rend="italic">Vacu<lb break="no"/>um Boyleanum</hi>, and

                     </name>and Him<lb break="no"/>self observ'd, for above four or five months, without any <lb/>diminution of its shining property. </p>
                        <p>He adds, That he hath lately found a way to affix this <lb/>Shining Matter to Glass, whereby some not unpleasing
                            <lb/>Experiments may be made. Thus far Dr. <name type="person" ref="1149" rend="italic">Slare</name>. </p>
                        <p>As to his Ingenious Conjectures of the Subject and <lb/>Cause of Light in this <hi rend="italic">Phosphorus:</hi>
                            because he hath desired <lb/>my Opinion, I shall therefore subjoyn it in a few lines. </p>
                        <p>As to the first, What it is which gives the Light: It <lb/>seems hard to say, Whether it be the <hi rend="italic">Cretaceous Salt</hi>, the <lb/>
                     <hi rend="italic">Nitrous Salt</hi>, or some <hi rend="italic">Igneous
                                Particles</hi> incorporated with <lb/>them in the Operation? It is plain, That one way or other, <lb/>they do all concur
                  to produce it. </p>
                        <p>As to the Question, How these <hi rend="italic">Particles</hi> give light? It <lb/>should first be stated, What Light
                            is; Whether it be a <lb/>Body? Which, though much disputed, yet in strict speak<lb break="no"/>ing, is an absurd Question; all one, as
                            to ask, Whether a <lb/>Quality, be a Body? But the meaning of the Question is, <lb/>or ought to be, Whether there be any
                            Body in Nature, <lb/>which is the peculiar subject of Light, or metonymically <lb/>may be called Light? Or whether more
                            Bodies than one, <lb/>may successively be the immediate subject thereof? If so, <lb/>Whether it be any other Adjunct besides
                            Motion? If only <lb/>Motion, Whether as there is one peculiar Motion, at least <lb/>for a Musical sound, so another for
                            Light? And in regard <lb/>there are some Experiments which seem to favour each of <lb/>these Questions: such an Answer
                            should be given as will<pb n="357"/> correspond with all those experiments; and will be too long <lb/>to suit with this Catalogue. </p>
                        <p>I shall here only say, I am inclined to believe, That, in <lb/>this Case, all the three Bodies above mention'd serve
                            toge<lb break="no"/>ther to compose an Apt Recipient of that which is the <lb/>true Luminous Body. That, as in the mixture of <hi rend="italic">Sulphur</hi> 
                     <lb/>and <hi rend="italic">Water</hi>, sulphurious <hi rend="italic">Salts</hi>, of
                            affinity with both, are <lb/>used as a medium: so here, the Cretaceous Parts serve to <lb/>fix the Nitrous; and the Nitrous,
                            to fix the Igneous; being <lb/>of a middle nature and readily incorporated with them <lb/>both. And being in this union
                            exposed to the Sun Beams, <lb/>or other Light, the Igneous parts serve, for some time, to re<lb break="no"/>tain a certain portion of
                            such as are Luminous, or to give, <lb/>as I may say, a degree of Fixation to These also: and that <lb/>therefore this
                            Mixture is kindled or made to shine, by puting <lb/>it into the Light, as a stick is made to burn, by puting it into

                     <hi rend="italic">Lectures</hi> at <name type="place" ref="67" rend="italic">Oxford</name>, on the <hi rend="italic">Vespers</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Publique Act:</hi>
                            the <lb/>one, in the Year, 1652. as to the Construction of it; the <lb/>other, in the Year, 1653. as to the computation of
                            what <lb/>weight every Joynt of it sustains; whereby it might be the <lb/>better judged how far it may be safely practised.
                            The <lb/>greatest weight charged on any one Joynt, doth not <lb/>amount to Ten-times the weight of one Beam: And the
                            <lb/>greatest weight bor'n by any one Beam; not to seventeen <lb/>times its own weight: and even this, not laid all on the
                            <lb/>same part, but distributed to several parts of it. The sum <lb/>of these two <hi rend="italic">Lectures</hi>, is to be
                            seen in the Sixth Chapter of <lb/>my Book <bibl rend="italic">de Motu</bibl>. </p>
                  <pb n="362"/>
                        <p>A Third <hi rend="italic">Lecture</hi>, much to the same purpose, I read, <lb/>
                     <hi rend="italic">May</hi>, 1699. in the
                            same place, before the present <name type="person" ref="213">Grand <lb/>Duke of <name type="place" ref="177" rend="italic">Tuscany</name>
                     </name>, who honoured the <name type="place" ref="67">University</name> with a
                            <lb/>Visit, and me with his Presence at that <hi rend="italic">Lecture</hi>. After <lb/>which, he was pleased very
                            particularly to consider both <lb/>the Delineation and Model, and declared himself very well <lb/>pleased with it, </p>
                        <p>The contrivance is obvious to the Eye. The outsides re<lb break="no"/>present the Walls of the Building on which this Flat Floor <lb/>or
                            Roof is to be laid. The Beams next adjoyning to the <lb/>sides, have one end lodged on those Walls; the other end
                            <lb/>sustained by another Beam, lying cross; both ends of <lb/>which, are in like manner sustained by other cross Beams; <lb/>and
                            those again by others; till they reach the other Walls. <lb/>So that no one of them can fall, unless the Walls fail, or
                            the <lb/>Beams break: all mutually sustaining each other without <lb/>any Pillar or Prop to support them, besides the outer
                            <lb/>Walls. </p>
                        <p>The Models I caused to be made, and that of the <name type="person" ref="11" rend="italic">Royal <lb/>Society</name> in
                            imitation thereof, are in Breadth, about four times <lb/>as much as the Length of the longest Beam. But may be
                            <lb/>continu'd, at pleasure, to farther breadth, as shall be thought <lb/>fit. With this Caution: That the farther the Work
                            is <lb/>continu'd, the greater Weight will be charged on every <lb/>Joynt; especially near the middle. And though in this
                            <lb/>Model, no one Beam is charged with so much as seventeen <lb/>times its own weight: yet if the Work be continu'd to a
                            <lb/>greater breadth, the proportional Weight will be thereby <lb/>increased. And therefore must be limited, according to
                            <lb/>the strength of Timber, able to bear more or fewer times <lb/>its own weight. </p>
                        <p>I do not know, that yet it hath been reduced to practise, <lb/>in more than four Pieces, in this Form. Such is <lb/>one of
                            the Floors in the <hi rend="italic">Tower</hi> of the Publique <lb/>Schools at <name type="place" ref="25" rend="italic">Oxford</name>: the Breadth whereof, to the <lb/>Length of the Beams, is as three to two. But <lb/>may
                            doubtless be continu'd much further: especially in <lb/>such a Roof or Floor, as is not to bear much more than its <lb/>own
                  weight. </p>
                  <p>
                     <seg>[Figure]</seg>
                  </p>
                        <p>Thus, for instance, a <hi rend="italic">Bowling-Green</hi> of near an Acre of <lb/>Ground, may be cover'd with a Frame
                            of long slender<pb n="363"/> pieces, without any other Prop than on the sides, for <lb/>
                     <hi rend="italic">Vines</hi>, or other like
                            <hi rend="italic">Plants</hi> to run upon, so as to shade the <lb/>whole. </p>
                        <p>Note here, That whereas the ends of the several pieces <lb/>are to lie upon those that cross them, about the middle
                            <lb/>thereof; it will be necessary at every Joynt to abate both <lb/>pieces half way, or near it; that one may be thus let
                            into <lb/>the other, and the whole reduced to a Flat. But whether <lb/>such piece, so abated doth end even with that on
                            which it <lb/>lies, or doth lie over somewhat beyond it; is indifferent. <lb/>And though That may seem more elegant; This,
                            perhaps, <lb/>may be fitter for use. </p>
                        <p>Each piece, I say, must be so abated half way, or near <lb/>it. For, whereas those Beams, especially if of a
                            considera<lb break="no"/>ble length, will, with the weight, bow a little; if this abate<lb break="no"/>ment be somewhat less than half way,
                            (whereby without <lb/>such bowing, the whole would somewhat rise in the mid<lb break="no"/>dle) it will by such bowing be reduced to a
                  Flat. </p>
                        <p>Note also, That a Frame thus contriv'd, needs neither <lb/>
                     <hi rend="italic">Nail</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">Pin</hi>;
                            the several pieces fastening, as well as support<lb break="no"/>ing one another. Yet, if it be to bear a great weight more than
                            <lb/>its own; it will be convenient to fasten each Joynt with <lb/>
                     <hi rend="italic">Pins</hi>; and, if need be, to
                            strengthen it with <hi rend="italic">Iron-Plates</hi>, or <lb/>line it with other pieces of <hi rend="italic">Timber</hi>, to be fasten'd with <hi rend="italic">Iron-<lb/>Bolts</hi>; to make amends for what is weaken'd by
                            the abate<lb break="no"/>ments at the <hi rend="italic">Joynts:</hi> which will make the whole Frame <lb/>exceeding strong. </p>

            <p>WHereas a Book Entitul'd, <hi rend="italic">Exercitatio Anatomico-Medica de Glandulis Intestinorum, earumque Usu &amp;
                    Affectibus. Cui subjungitur Anatome Ventriculi Gellinacei. Studio Joh. Conradi Peyeri Scafhu[. . . .]a-Helvetij</hi>,
                1677. In which are found some of those Observations contained in the following Lectures. It was therefore thought fit, here to
                take Notice, That the said Book was not Published, till the Year after these Lectures were Read. </p>

            <head><hi rend="italic">CHAP. I</hi>. Of the Stomachs and Guts of Six Carnivorous Quadrupeds; <hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. The
                Weesle, Fitchet, Polecat, Cat, Dog and Fox. </head>
            <p>I Am not ignorant of what many Learned and Inquisitive Men, both at home and abroad, especially in this last <hi rend="italic"
                    >Century</hi>, have performed in the Anatomy of Animals. After all whom, if it be demanded, what is left for me to do? I
                Answer in the words of <hi rend="italic">Seneca</hi>, [Note: Epist. 64.] <hi rend="italic">Multum adhuc restat operis,
                    multœmque restabit; nec ulli Nato, post mille S&#x00E6;cula, pr&#x00E6;cludetur occasio, aliquid adhuc adjiciendi</hi>. </p>
            <p>I shall omit most of what is already noted by <hi rend="italic">Anatomists</hi>; and princially speak of those things, which
                have hitherto been unobserv'd. </p>

            <div>
                <head>A Weesle. </head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">Weesle</hi> (which from the Ears to the setting on of the Tail was
                    10 inches) about five inches long, &#x00BC; in Diametre, equally wide, and thin. Enters the Stomach at the left End. </p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Stomach</hi> about three inches long; proportionably, more than a <hi rend="italic">Dogs</hi>. An
                    inch in Diametre at the upper Orifice; at the nether, &#x00BC;; having a <hi rend="italic">flexure</hi> towards its
                    Conjunction with the Guts: shaped like to the body of a pair of <hi rend="italic">Bag-Pipes</hi>. Thin, and plain, or
                    without Folds. Which seems to be the property of the Stomachs of most Rapacious <hi rend="italic">Quadrupeds</hi>. </p>
                <p>The Guts <hi rend="italic">thin</hi>, and plain, or with little store of <hi rend="italic">Glands</hi>, especially of such
                    as in most <hi rend="italic">Carnivorous</hi> Animals are conspicuous. About a yard in length, and 1/[. . . .] an inch in
                    Diametre; without any considerable contraction, difference of Size, Texture or Substance from the <hi rend="italic"
              >Stomach</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi>. No <hi rend="italic">Colon</hi>. No <hi rend="italic"
              >C&#x00E6;cum</hi>. So that it seems to be all but <hi rend="italic">One single Gut</hi>. Contrary to what is seen in
                    any other <hi rend="italic">Quadruped</hi>, I have opened. </p>
                <p>At the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi>, a Couple of <hi rend="italic">Bags</hi> grow to the Gut; one on each side. Each of
                    them, fill'd, about the bigness of a large <hi rend="italic">Garden-Peas:</hi> containing a yellow, and thickish Liquor,
                    extraordinary <hi rend="italic">f&#x0153;tid</hi>, and having the peculiar scent of the Animal in the most intense degree.
                    Over the <hi rend="italic">Bags</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Bladders</hi>, is spread the <hi rend="italic"
              >Sphincter-Muscle</hi>; which compressing <hi rend="italic">Them</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi> both
                    together, forceth them to a contemporary evacution. </p>
                <p>I have not yet dissected the <hi rend="italic">Civet-Cat</hi>, but suppose, that these Bags are analogous to those that
                    contain the <hi rend="italic">Civet</hi> in that Animal. </p>
                <p>These Bags, so far as I have observ'd, are proper to all <hi rend="italic">Carnivorous Quadrupeds</hi>, and those only: as
                    will further appear by the following Examples. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <head>A Fitchet. </head>
                <p>A FITCHET, being of kin to the <hi rend="italic">Weesle</hi>; hath also a <hi rend="italic">Stomach</hi> and <hi
              rend="italic">Guts</hi> much alike. </p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Guts</hi> about a yard and two inches. At most, but two. The first, about two feet and 1/[. . . .]
                    long; and [. . . .]/[. . . .]<hi rend="sup">ths</hi> of an inch over, where widest. Hath five or six Necks or
                    Contractions. And a little before most of them, stands a small <hi rend="italic">Cluster</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
              >Glands</hi>, about as big as a <hi rend="italic">Silver Half-peny</hi>. The second, is about 1/[. . . .] a quarter of
                    a yard long, and 1/[. . . .] an inch over where widest. Very thin, plain, and without any <hi rend="italic">Glands</hi>
                    visible to the bare Eye. </p>
                <p>On each side the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi>, there is also a Bag of <hi rend="italic">f&#x0153;tid</hi> Liquor, with the
                    stink of the Animal. </p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Guts</hi> of these Two Animals, and I suppose likewise of the <hi rend="italic">Ferret</hi>, are the
                    most simple, and plain, of all I have observ'd in <hi rend="italic">Quadrupeds</hi>. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <head>A Pole-Cat. </head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Stomach</hi> of a POLE-CAT, are in shape like those of a <hi
              rend="italic">Weesle</hi>. But the <hi rend="italic">Guts</hi> are different. </p>
                <p>They may be reckon'd, four. The first, about [. . . .]/4 of a <hi rend="italic">yard</hi> long; 1/[. . . .] an inch over;
                    very thin, and plain. </p>
                <p>The second, [. . . .]/[. . . .] of a yard in length; &#x00BC; of an inch over, and in some places more. This <hi
              rend="italic">Gut</hi> is Glandulous and very thick, in comparison with the other, from end to end. The Glands extream
                    small, no bigger than little <hi rend="italic">Pins heads</hi>. Yet every Gland hath its <hi rend="italic">Ori[. . .
              .]ice</hi>, out of which a <hi rend="italic">Mucus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pituita</hi> may be visibly squeez'd. </p>
                <p>The Third, is &#x00BD; a yard long; and about [. . . .]/[. . . .] an inch over, as the first. About the middle hereof, is a
              <hi rend="italic">Cluster</hi> (of petite <hi rend="italic">Glands</hi>) about two inches long, and &#x00BC; of an
                    inch broad. At the further end also, joyning to the fourth <hi rend="italic">Gut</hi>, is another like <hi rend="italic"
              >Cluster</hi>, but as broad again. Each Gland in both these <hi rend="italic">Clusters</hi>, is about the bigness of a
              <hi rend="italic">Mustard-Seed</hi>. </p>
                <p>Each of these <hi rend="italic">Clusters</hi>, may be called a little <hi rend="italic">PANCREAS INTESTINALE</hi>. Their
                    difference is, That This hath not one common <hi rend="italic">Ductus</hi>. </p>
                <p>Of these <hi rend="italic">Clusters</hi>, it is observable, That both here, and in all the other Animals hereafter
                    mention'd, they stand directly opposite to that side of the <hi rend="italic">Gut</hi>, into which the Vessels are
                    inserted. </p>
                <p>The Fourth, or <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, is separated from the former by a Contraction. Almost five inches long; and
                    near the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi>, &#x00BC; of an inch in Diametre. So that all the <hi rend="italic">Guts</hi>
                    together, are two yards, within &#x00BD; a quarter. </p>
                <p>This Animal hath neither <hi rend="italic">Colon</hi>, nor <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>. </p>
                <p>At the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi>, a pair of <hi rend="italic">Bladders</hi> grow to the <hi rend="italic">Gut</hi>, as in
                    a <hi rend="italic">Weesle</hi>; containing also a Liquor with the peculiar <hi rend="italic">f&#x0153;tor</hi> of the
                    Animal, most intense. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <head>A Cat. </head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi> of a well grown CAT, [. . . .]/[. . . .] of an inch, where widest. The Texture two-fold.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Muscular Fibers</hi> of the upper half next the Throat, plainly <hi rend="italic">Platted</hi>. A
                    sort of Work, which will best be seen in the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">Sheep</hi>. Those of the
                    other half, rather <hi rend="italic">Annular</hi>, though not exactly so. </p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Stomach</hi> in shape like that of a <hi rend="italic">Dog</hi>, and most other <hi rend="italic"
              >Carnivorous Quadrupeds</hi>; only somewhat shorter and rounder; being not above five inches long, yet 3[. . . .]/[. .
                    . .] over. </p>
                <p>But in the <hi rend="italic">Guts</hi> divers Specialties are observable. Altogether, about two yards and [. . . .]/4 long.
                    With respect to their substance, but two in number: To their shape, the first may be subdivided into four. </p>
                <p>This first may be called <hi rend="italic">Musculare:</hi> being in proportion, thicker or more carneous than the <hi
              rend="italic">Guts</hi> of any <hi rend="italic">Quadruped</hi> I have open'd. </p>
                <p>It hath about 28 or 30 <hi rend="italic">Contractions</hi>; some an inch, others two or three inches distant one from
                    another. I have not seen a quarter so many in any other Animal. It may be subdivided into four. </p>
                <p>The First, <hi rend="italic">i. e</hi>. from the <hi rend="italic">Stomach</hi> to the place where the <hi rend="italic"
              >Gut</hi> is considerably amplify'd, about a &#x00BC; of a yard; and somewhat more than &#x00BC; of an inch, over. </p>
                <p>The Second, <hi rend="italic">i. e</hi>. to the place where more conspicuously contracted, about &#x00BD; a yard; and in
                    its widest place, above [. . . .]/[. . . .] an inch, over. </p>
                <p>The Third, <hi rend="italic">i. e</hi>. to the next greater dilatation, a yard and [. . . .]/[. . . .]<hi rend="sup"
              >th</hi>; and [. . . .]/[. . . .]<hi rend="sup">ths</hi> of an inch, over; near the same width with that of the first. </p>
                <p>The Fourth, about 1/[. . . .] a yard and 1/[. . . .]<hi rend="sup">th</hi>; and &#x00BD; inch, over. So that two slender,
                    and two ample ones are reciprocally joyn'd. </p>
                <p>This <hi rend="italic">Intest. Musculare</hi>, is furnished with several <hi rend="italic">Clusters</hi> of <hi
              rend="italic">Glands</hi>, six or seven in number: each <hi rend="italic">Cluster</hi> about &#x00BC; of an inch long;
                    and the last above three inches. This especially, as in the <hi rend="italic">Pole-Cat</hi>, may be called <hi
              rend="italic">PANCREAS INTESTINALE</hi>. </p>
                <p>The Next <hi rend="italic">Gut</hi> (in the place of the <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>) may be called <hi rend="italic"
              >Membranaceum</hi>, in distinction from the former; being far more perspicuous and thin. About &#x00BD; a yard long;
                    and where widest, an inch and &#x00BC;, over. So that its hollow is more than four times as great as of any part of the
              <hi rend="italic">Intest. Musculare</hi>; and eight or ten times as great as of the small parts. And doth therefore
                    contain far more than all that <hi rend="italic">Gut</hi>. </p>
                <p>To the undermost part of this <hi rend="italic">Gut</hi>, about an inch and [. . . .]/[. . . .] before the <hi
              rend="italic">Anus</hi>, is fasten'd the end of a slender <hi rend="italic">Muscle</hi>; the other extremity, to one
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Vertebr&#x00E6;</hi> of the Loins. </p>
                <p>This <hi rend="italic">Gut</hi> is furnished with several large <hi rend="italic">Glands</hi>, not standing in <hi
              rend="italic">Clusters</hi>, but singly, as in a <hi rend="italic">Fox</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">Dog</hi> presently
                    to be describ'd; but not so big. </p>
                <p>The upper End of this <hi rend="italic">Gut</hi> where it joyns to the <hi rend="italic">Muscular</hi>, for the length of
                    [. . . .]/4 of an inch, is partly Conick and partly Helick; being, as it were, the beginning of a <hi rend="italic"
              >C&#x00E6;cum</hi>. </p>
                <p>On each side the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi>, a Bag of <hi rend="italic">f&#x0153;tid</hi> Liquor, as in the former
                    Animals. </p>
                <p>To the <hi rend="italic">Guts</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">Cat</hi>, I suppose those of a <hi rend="italic">Leopard,
              Tiger</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Lion</hi>, may have some Analogy. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <head>A Bitch. </head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi> of a BITCH (from the top of her Head to the setting on of her Tail about &#x00BE; of a
                    yard) near an inch in Diametre. Somewhat thick, redish, and muscular. </p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Stomach</hi> shaped as a <hi rend="italic">Cats</hi>, saving that it is a little longer. In length,
                    nine inches; in breadth, six; in depth, as much. Somewhat <hi rend="italic">Muscular</hi>, as the <hi rend="italic"
              >Gulet</hi>. Not very visibly Glandulous, except near the lower <hi rend="italic">Orifice</hi>. Where, for the space
                    of three or four inches, are a great number of small Glands, yet fairly observable round about. </p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Guts</hi> are Four. The Frist, or <hi rend="italic">Crassum</hi>, two yards and &#x00BD;, and near an
                    inch over, where widest. </p>
                <p>The Second, or <hi rend="italic">Tenue</hi>, about a yard and [. . . .]/4 long, and somewhat more than [. . . .]/[. . . .]
                    an inch wide. </p>
                <p>The Third, or <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, where widest, near an inch; and about &#x00BD; a foot long; but winding
                    with three flexures, three several ways. Not joyned to the <hi rend="italic">Tenue</hi>, but the <hi rend="italic"
              >Rectum</hi>; and so postur'd, as to make an acute Angle not with the <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, but the <hi
              rend="italic">Tenue</hi>; in other Animals. And the passage between This and the <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>
                    somewhat straight. </p>
                <p>The Fourth, or <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, half a yard; next the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, an inch over; near
                    the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi> an inch and &#x00BE;. All the <hi rend="italic">Guts</hi> together, near five yards. </p>
                <p>This only, of the Animals yet mention'd, hath a <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>. Yet without a <hi rend="italic"
              >Colon</hi>. </p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Guts</hi> of this Animal, as well as the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi>, are all of them thick, redish,
                    and Muscular. The like, I suppose, are those of all <hi rend="italic">Ossivorous Quadrupeds</hi>. </p>
                <p>They are furnished with store of <hi rend="italic">Glands</hi>. In the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, at several
                    distances from 1/[. . . .]<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to [. . . .]/[. . . .]<hi rend="sup">ths</hi> of an inch. Very
                    conspicuous to the naked Eye, even after they are blown up and dry'd. In the two foremost, they stand in <hi rend="italic"
              >Clusters</hi>; and the Clusters in all, about 20. Some of them round, as big as a <hi rend="italic">Silver Peny</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Two-peny</hi>; and some Oval, the compass of an <hi rend="italic">Almond:</hi> and some, especially
                    towards the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, two or three inches long, and &#x00BD; an inch broad. Every Gland, as big
                    as a <hi rend="italic">Turnep-Seed</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi> besprinkled with Flat Glands, the breadth
                    of a <hi rend="italic">Marshmallow-Seed</hi> or little Spangle. And so the <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, especially
                    towards the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi>; but here big. </p>
                <p>In the centre of these Flat Glands, the <hi rend="italic">Orifice</hi>, or if you will the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi> of
                    every Gland is very conspicuous: by which the Gland speweth out a certain <hi rend="italic">Mucus</hi> or <hi
              rend="italic">Pituita</hi>; as by compressing the Gut may be easily seen. </p>
                <p>So that although the Glands of the Stomach and Guts, especially in Men and <hi rend="italic">Quadrupeds</hi>, seem to lie
                    behind, or under the inner Membrane: yet the Mouths of them all, do open into the Hollow of the Stomach and Guts. The <hi
              rend="italic">Pituita</hi> which is always found very copious in both, not being half of it, the spittle, or bred of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Aliment</hi>, as is generally conceiv'd; but spewed out of these Glands. </p>
                <p>At the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi>, are two Bags of stinking Liquor, as in the aforesaid Animals. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <head>A Fox. </head>
                <p>The Gulet, Stomach and Guts of a FOX, (&#x00BD; a year old, and 1/[. . . .] yard from Head to Tail) are much like to those
                    of a <hi rend="italic">Dog</hi>. But with some differences. The Gulet, in proportion, somewhat larger. The Stomach deeper. </p>
                <p>The first Gut, or the <hi rend="italic">Crassum</hi>, far shorter, not above 1/[. . . .] a foot. The second, or the <hi
              rend="italic">Tenue</hi>, somewhat wider. The <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, much larger; near [. . . .]/4 of a
                    foot long. It lies not strait out, but is wound up almost spirally. Where it joyneth to the other Guts, &#x00BD; an inch
                    over; at the other End, near an inch. </p>
                <p>The Guts furnished with several Clusters of Glands, as in a <hi rend="italic">Dog</hi>, about 14 in number. That next the
              <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi> four inches long, and above &#x00BD; an inch broad. Before every large Cluster is
                    a little Contraction in the Gut. In the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi> much larger
                    than in the <hi rend="italic">Bitch</hi>. </p>
                <p>I suppose it is proper to all other Ossivorous Animals, for the <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi> to be furnish'd with such
                    Glands. </p>
                <p>Just upon the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi> lie two Bags of stinking Liquor, as in the Animals above-said. </p>

            <head><hi rend="italic">CHAP. II</hi>. Of the Stomach and Guts of the <hi rend="italic">Mole</hi>; which seems to feed on Insects.
                As also of the <hi rend="italic">Urchan, Squirel</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Rat</hi>; which are chiefly Frugivorous. </head>
            <head>A Mole. </head>
            <p>T<choice><sic>H</sic><corr>h</corr></choice>e Gulet of a MOLE, is not fasten'd to the End of the Stomach, as in the foregoing
                Animals, but to the middle. </p>
            <p>The Stomach shaped somewhat like that of a <hi rend="italic">Polecat</hi>, and is as big; being three inches long, an inch and
                &#x00BC; broad, and as deep: which in comparison with the small bulk of the Animal, is exceeding great: this Animal weighing
                not much above three Ounces; but an ordinary <hi rend="italic">Polecat</hi> betwixt 20 and 30. </p>
            <p>The Guts, a yard and &#x00BC; long; longer than in the Carnivorous kind. About &#x00BC; of an inch over every where. Near the
                    <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi> a little wider. So that they seem, so far, to be but two. Yet taking in their Texture, they
                may be three. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Texture</hi> of the First (about [. . . .]/4 of a yard long) is plain and simple, to the Eye, as in other
                Guts. Of the Second, extreme Curious; the <hi rend="italic">Fibers</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Muscular Membrane</hi>,
                making <hi rend="italic">Undulations</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Indentures</hi>, continued for the length of [. . . .]/4 of a
                yard, round about the Gut: very much resembling the <hi rend="italic">Needle-work</hi>, commonly called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Irish-stich</hi>. But the <hi rend="italic">Graver</hi>, though in other respects he hath done tolerably well, yet cometh
                short of the elegancy of this Work. </p>
            <p>Both these Guts are furnish'd with five or six small Clusters of Glands; each Cluster as big as a little Spangle. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, of a plain Texture, as the First. And without any conspicuous Glands. Half a &#x00BC; of a
                yard long, and where widest, &#x00BD; inch over. </p>
            <p>Here are none of the Bags described in the <hi rend="italic">Weesle, &amp;c</hi>. Nor any <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>

            <div>
                <head>An Urchan. </head>
                <p>The Gulet of an URCHAN enters the Stomach towards the middle, as in a <hi rend="italic">Mole</hi>. Somewhat small, not
                    &#x00BC; of an inch over. </p>
                <p>The Stomach not so large as in the <hi rend="italic">Mole</hi>, yet bigger than in Carnivorous Animals; as than that of a
              <hi rend="italic">Weesle</hi>, although the Body of an <hi rend="italic">Urchan</hi> of the same age be no bigger, as
                    is plain, when the Skins of both are taken off. 'Tis also of a rounder shape. </p>
                <p>The Guts, for substance, seem to be but One. But from the difference of shape, may be accounted Four. The First, or <hi
              rend="italic">Crassum</hi>, a yard and [. . . .]/[. . . .]<hi rend="sup">th</hi> long; and near &#x00BD; an inch over,
                    where widest. It hath several, about 12 observable Contractions; some of them an inch or two long, some more, and some
                    less: which, as to their length, is peculiar to this Animal. </p>
                <p>The Second, or <hi rend="italic">Gracile</hi>, is about &#x00BE; of a yard long; &#x00BC; of an inch over, and of an equal
                    size throughout. </p>
                <p>The Third, or <hi rend="italic">Amplissimum</hi>, [. . . .]/[. . . .]<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of a yard long; and above
                    &#x00BE; of an inch over, where widest. </p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, about as long; and above &#x00BD; an inch over. So the length of all the Guts, is Two
                    yards and an inch or two: much longer, than in the Carnivorous kind. </p>
                <p>The Third and Last, are sprinkled with an innumerable company of extream small Glands, scarce discernible without a Glass;
                    through which, they shew as big as little <hi rend="italic">Pins heads</hi>. </p>
                <p>This Animal hath none of those Bags near the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi>, above described in the <hi rend="italic">Weesle,
              &amp;c</hi>. Hath no <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>. No <hi rend="italic">Colon</hi>. </p>

            <div>
                <head>A Squirell. </head>
                <p>That I open'd, was a <hi rend="italic">Virginian</hi>, smaller than the <hi rend="italic">European</hi>. The Gulet enters
                    the Stomach towards the middle, as in a <hi rend="italic">Mole</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Urchan</hi> very small, like the
                    top of an <hi rend="italic">Oaten-straw:</hi> so that the upper <hi rend="italic">Orifice</hi> of the Stomach, hardly lets
                    any thing, so much as wind, to pass into it. </p>
                <p>The Stomach two inches long; the left end, an inch over; the right, &#x00BD; an inch. </p>
                <p>The Guts may be reckon'd Four. The First, which reacheth to the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, above &#x00BD; a yard
                    long; and near &#x00BC; of an inch over. </p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi> very large, near three inches long, and about &#x00BD; an inch over. Lies spirally
                    wound up on it self. </p>
                <p>The Third, about three inches long, not above &#x00BD;<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of an inch over. </p>
                <p>The Last, about as long. Hath two Contractions and Dilatations; where widest, &#x00BC; of an inch over. All the Guts
                    together without the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, not &#x00BE; of a yard: the shortest of all yet describ'd. </p>
                <p>Here are none of those Bags upon the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi>, above mention'd. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>A Rat. </head>
                <p>The Gulet of a RAT, is extream small, like that of a <hi rend="italic">Squirel</hi>; and inserted into the Stomach in the
                    same manner. </p>
                <p>The Stomach, with respect to that of a <hi rend="italic">Mole</hi>, very small; <hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. three times
                    less: although the Body of a <hi rend="italic">Rat</hi>, is above twice as big as the Body of a <hi rend="italic"
              >Mole</hi>. </p>
                <p>The substance hereof is also more plainly distinguish'd into two sorts. One half, towards the left end, more pellucid, thin
                    and membranous. The other half, <hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. from the Insertion of the Gulet to the <hi rend="italic"
              >Pylorus</hi>, more opacous, thick and Muscular. </p>
                <p>The Guts may be accounted Five. The First, or <hi rend="italic">Gracile</hi>, [. . . .]/2 an Eln long, and &#x00BC; of an
                    inch over. </p>
                <p>The Second, or <hi rend="italic">Amplum</hi>, &#x00BD; a yard long, and 1/[. . . .]<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of an inch over. </p>
                <p>In these two together, are eleven or twelve Clusters of Glands; every Cluster about the breadth of a Spangle. </p>
                <p>The Third, or <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, contained by a Ligament in an Orbicular posture round about the <hi
              rend="italic">Amplum</hi>. Above &#x00BD; an inch over, and three inches long. So that take it breadth and length, and
                    it is as big as the Stomach it self. </p>
                <p>The Fourth, I crave leave to call the <hi rend="italic">Abomafideum:</hi> for that it is in figure or structure very like
                    to that <hi rend="italic">Ventricle</hi> in a <hi rend="italic">Sheep</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Cow</hi>, called the <hi
              rend="italic">Abomasus</hi>. About two inches long; and near its Conjunction with the <hi rend="italic"
              >C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, [. . . .]/[. . . .]<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of an inch over, narrowing all the way to the other end.
                    That which is curions herein, is, That 'tis furnished with a considerable number of oblique Plates, about 46; 23 or
                    thereabout, on each side oppositely; exactly like to those in the <hi rend="italic">Abomasus</hi> of a <hi rend="italic"
              >Sheep</hi>. </p>
                <p>The Last, or <hi rend="italic">Stercoraceum</hi>, is six inches long; &#x00BC; of an inch over, where widest. And hath one
                    or two Contractions, as in a <hi rend="italic">Squirel</hi>. </p>
                <p>The Gulet, Stomach and Guts of a MOUSE, are little different. Only the Glands of the Guts fewer; and the <hi rend="italic"
              >C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, less. </p>
                <p>On the contrary, in a SHREW-MOUSE, the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi> is rather greater, being [. . . .]/[. . . .]<hi
              rend="sup">d</hi> of an inch over, and two inches long. Yet the Body of the Animal five or six times less than that of
                    a <hi rend="italic">Rat</hi>. </p>

            <head><hi rend="italic">CHAP. III</hi>. Of the Stomach and Guts of such Animals as are both Frugivorous and Graminivorous; as the
                    <hi rend="italic">Rabbit, Horse</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Pig</hi>. </head>
            <head>A Rabbit. </head>
            <p>T<choice><sic>H</sic><corr>h</corr></choice>e Gulet of a RABBIT is inserted into the middle of the Stomach, as in a <hi
                    rend="italic">Rat</hi>. </p>
            <p>The Stomach shaped almost like a <hi rend="italic">Dogs</hi>, but bigger, with respect to the Animal. Its inner Membrane is
                gather'd up into several little Plates, like those in a Man. At the End next the <hi rend="italic">Pylorus</hi>, much thicker,
                and more Glandulous, Nervous, and Muscular than in any other part. </p>
            <p>The Guts, without the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, are four yards long. In number, five. The First, or <hi
                    rend="italic">Jejunum</hi>, about four feet long, and [. . . .] an inch over. </p>
            <p>The Second, or <hi rend="italic">Ileum</hi>, as long; and above &#x00BD; an inch over. Whereas in some, as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Polecat, Dog, Urchan</hi>, the Second Gut is smaller than the First. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Jejunum</hi> is besprinkled with a great number of very small Glands: which when the Guts are blown up
                and dry, look like a multitude of little Specks. Whence the Gut is more opacous than the <hi rend="italic">Ileum</hi>. </p>
            <p>Besides these smaller Glands, the <hi rend="italic">Jejunum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ileum</hi> together, are furnished with
                four or five Clusters, about as broad as a <hi rend="italic">Two-penys</hi>; and every Gland as big as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wallflower-Seeds</hi>. </p>
            <p>Where the <hi rend="italic">Ileum</hi> enters the <hi rend="italic">Colon</hi>, it hath a very thick white and Glandulous Body,
                or <hi rend="italic">Pancreas Intestinale:</hi> and the mouth of each Gland very apparent. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, of a prodigious size; above &#x00BD; a yard long, and and an inch and &#x00BD; over
                where widest. </p>
            <p>At the End of the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi> hangs a certain Label, also continuously hollow with the <hi
                    rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, and may be accounted part of it. Betwixt three and four inches long; and at the upper
                end, [. . . .]/4 of an inch over; in shape like a Man's Finger. Lined quite through with a thick Glandulous Body, like that in
                the end of the <hi rend="italic">Ileum</hi>. </p>
            <p>All the rest of the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi> very thin, and transparent: so as being blown up, it looks like those
                Skins of <hi rend="italic">Iceing-Glass</hi>, formerly us'd for Transparent <hi rend="italic">Flower-Works</hi>. </p>
            <p>This Gut seemeth at first, to have many <hi rend="italic">Valvul&#x00E6; Conniventes</hi>. But by being blown up, is fairly
                represented one single <hi rend="italic">Valve</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Plate</hi>, stretched out perpendicularly from the
                circuit of the Gut, and most curiously winding, in a spiral Line, from one End to the other. </p>
            <p>This Gut runs into the <hi rend="italic">Colon</hi>, which is above a foot long, where widest or next the <hi rend="italic"
                    >C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, an inch over; at the other end &#x00BD; an inch. It hath a double <hi rend="italic">Vinculum</hi>, one
                on each side; by which 'tis gather'd up into a great number of little Cells, contiguous one to another throughout. </p>
            <p>In opening this Animal, being just dead, the <hi rend="italic">Peristaltick</hi> motion of the Guts, was very apparent,
                especially in this Gut. By means whereof, the several Cells aforesaid, were made reciprocally to move in and out; so as while
                one moved and was convex inward, another next adjacent, moved and was convex outward; and so on by a kind of undulation, for
                several inches together. </p>
            <p>This Gut is very thick and Glandulous all over, the Glands standing every where close and contiguous: so that the inside of the
                Gut, looks like the <hi rend="italic">Seal-Fishes</hi> Skin. The Glands are not flat, as in the Guts above describ'd, but
                standing up round and high, like an infinite number of <hi rend="italic">Papill&#x00E6;:</hi> the Mouths of each visibly open;
                from whence a <hi rend="italic">Mu us</hi> may easily be express'd. </p>
            <p>So that all Intestinal Glands are either Flat, or Spherical; both with a Mouth in the centre. Answering to a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Button-Mould</hi>; the Flat Gland, to a flat Mould; and the Sph&#x00E6;rical Gland to the like Mould. The former may be
                called <hi rend="italic">Rotulares:</hi> the latter <hi rend="italic">Papillares</hi>. </p>
            <p>The Last Gut is about four feet long; as wide as the <hi rend="italic">Ileum</hi>, and near the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi>
                wider by &#x00BC; of an inch. </p>
            <p>This Animal hath none of those Bags observed at the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi> of the Carnivorous kind. </p>
            <div>
                <head>A Horse. </head>
                <p>The Gulet of a HORSE, is large, thick, red, and very Muscular. The properties of the Gulet in all Voraceous <hi
              rend="italic">Quadrupeds</hi>. Inserted into the Stomach, not at one End, but the middle, as in a <hi rend="italic"
              >Rabbit</hi>. </p>
                <p>The Stomach single. Not much above a foot long, about &#x00BC; of a yard deep, and seven inches over. Which in respect to
                    the Animal, and especially to his Guts, is exceeding small, I had not time to observe the inside, but probably, 'tis
                    gather'd up into Plates or Folds as That of a <hi rend="italic">Rabbit</hi>. </p>
                <p>The Guts are six. The First, or small Gut, about 28 yards. Near the Stomach, two inches over; towards the other end, two
                    inches and &#x00BD;. Which though it be wider by far, than the same Gut in any other <hi rend="italic">Quadruped</hi> that
                    I have open'd: yet in respect to the Amplitude of the other Guts in this Animal, it may properly be called the <hi
              rend="italic">Small Gut</hi>. It hath six or eight Contractions or short narrow Necks; and amongst them, a long one,
                    about a foot before its entrance into the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>. </p>
                <p>It hath very few, and but small Clusters of those larger Glands, observable in the fore-mention'd Animals. But of a smaller
                    kind, the inner Coat is every where full as it can hold, each Gland not so big as a <hi rend="italic">Cheese-Mite</hi>. </p>
                <p>The Second, or <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, is square; having not two, but four Ligaments which contain it in that
                    figure. By means whereof the sides are also gather'd into many Cells, small and great, as the <hi rend="italic">Colon</hi>
                    it self in this and other Animals. </p>
                <p>The Bulk is vast: Near the Cone, or close end, about three inches over. But at the Base, or where it joyns to the <hi
              rend="italic">Colon</hi>, a &#x00BC; of a yard over. And in length, a full yard. So that it is more than twice as big
                    as the Stomach. </p>
                <p>The Learned Dr. <hi rend="italic">Glisson</hi>, in speaking of the Stomachs of <hi rend="italic">Quadrupeds</hi>, saith,
                    That a <hi rend="italic">Rabbit</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">Horse</hi> have a double <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>.
                    His words are these; <hi rend="italic">In Equis, Cuniculis, &amp; Porcellis Indicis, C&#x00E6;cum duplex
              deprehenditur</hi>. But herein he is mistaken. As to a <hi rend="italic">Rabbit</hi>, the contrary hath been seen in
                    the Guts presented entire before this Honourable Presence. And who ever will take the pains to examine all the Guts of a
              <hi rend="italic">Horse</hi>, will find, That neither hath he, any more than One <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>,
                    which I have above describ'd. </p>
                <p>The Third Gut, is the <hi rend="italic">Colon</hi>. The unusual shape, and prodigious Amplitude whereof, might give
                    occasion to the Doctor to mistake it for another <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>. So that although a <hi rend="italic"
              >Horse</hi> hath but one single <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>; yet may he not improperly be said to have a
                    Treble <hi rend="italic">Colon; sc</hi>. Two Ample ones, next the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>; and a smaller one
                    next the <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>. Unless any please rather to call the two Great ones, the two <hi rend="italic"
              >BELLIES</hi> of one and the same <hi rend="italic">Colon</hi>. </p>
                <p>The First <hi rend="italic">Belly</hi> next the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, is no less where widest, than &#x00BC;
                    of a yard over; and in length, above a yard and 1/[. . . .]. </p>
                <p>The Second Belly, next the <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, as wide as the former; and above a yard long. So that each of
                    these Bellies are bigger than the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>. That next the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>
                    half as big again: And about four times as big as the Stomach. </p>
                <p>These two Bellies are joyn'd together by a <hi rend="italic">Neck</hi>, about four inches over, and &#x00BC; of a yard
                    long. Gather'd likewise into Cells, as all the other parts of the <hi rend="italic">Colon</hi>. But with four Ligaments,
                    as the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>. By which also they lie square. And upon a passing view, might be another
                    occasion of the forementioned mistake. So that if any one shall call either of these <hi rend="italic">Bellies</hi>, a <hi
              rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>; then a <hi rend="italic">Horse</hi> will not have two only, but three <hi
              rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cums</hi>. But these <hi rend="italic">Bellies</hi> have neither of them, the defining property
                    of a <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>; which is, To be pervious at one end only. </p>
                <p>The small <hi rend="italic">Colon</hi>, or the smaller part of it, runs betwixt the Second Belly and the <hi rend="italic"
              >Rectum:</hi> likewise full of Cells, contain'd together by two opposite Ligaments as in other Animals. 'Tis about
                    three inches over; and six yards long. </p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, very thick and Muscular, as in most other large <hi rend="italic">Quadrupeds</hi>;
                    about three inches and &#x00BD; over, and not above &#x00BD; a yard long. The length of all the Guts (without the <hi
              rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>) is about 37 yards. So that the Guts of a Horse, although they come much short of
                    those of the Animals next mention'd: yet in wideness, much exceed them: So as to contain about ten times more than his
                    Stomach. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>A Pig. </head>
                <p>That which I procur'd was but 16 days old. The Gulet was torn off; so that I could only observe the Insertion, of it, which
                    is about the middle of the Stomach, as in a Horse. But that of a <hi rend="italic">Hog</hi>, I have often seen, and it is
                    very thick, muscular and red. </p>
                <p>The Stomach, was five inches long, and three over. Shaped somewhat oddly; in a manner with a double <hi rend="italic"
              >Ventricle</hi>. The one, and the principal, may be called <hi rend="italic">Venter magnus</hi>, shaped like that of
                    Carnivorous <hi rend="italic">Quadrupeds</hi>. Very thick and Muscular; especially in the Neck and at the <hi
              rend="italic">Pylorus</hi>. </p>
                <p>Against the <hi rend="italic">Pylorus</hi> stands a round Caruncle, as big as a small <hi rend="italic">Filbert
                    Kernel</hi>, like a stopple to the <hi rend="italic">Pylorus</hi>. A part I think peculiar to this Animal. </p>
                <p>This <hi rend="italic">Ventricle</hi> within, hath several Folds, about <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of an
                    inch broad, and as deep; and wind to and and fro, as in a <hi rend="italic">Rabbit</hi> or a Man. Scituate only about the
                    right End or half of the Belly: the other End being, though also Muscular, yet very plain. </p>
                <p>At the left End of this greater <hi rend="italic">Ventricle</hi>, another far less, yet distinct one, is appendent. Much
                    after the same manner as the <hi rend="italic">Reticulum</hi> in a <hi rend="italic">Sheep</hi> is to the <hi
              rend="italic">Panch</hi>. Or as the <hi rend="italic">Intestinum C&#x00E6;cum</hi> to the other Guts: for which reason
                    it may be called <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cus Ventriculus</hi>. Separated from the greater by a Muscular Ligament, like
                    a half <hi rend="italic">Valve</hi>. Where it joyns to it, an inch and &#x00BD; over, and thence extended two inches in
                    length; ending in a twisted or hooked <hi rend="italic">Cone</hi>. Not so Muscular, as the greater <hi rend="italic"
              >Venter</hi>, but thin and Membranous. The inner surface also plain, or without Folds. Yet is it Glandulous, as the
                    other: but the <hi rend="italic">Mucus</hi> the Glands yield somewhat thiner. </p>
                <p>The Guts of this <hi rend="italic">Pig</hi> (so young) were near fourteen yards in length. Which is more than doubled,
                    perhaps trebled in a well grown <hi rend="italic">Hog</hi>. They may be reckon'd six or seven. The First, hath several
                    Flexures, next the Stomach, within the length of a &#x00BC; of a yard, and may be called <hi rend="italic"
              >Serpentinum</hi>. </p>
                <p>The Second, about five yards and &#x00BD; long, and &#x00BD; an inch or 5/[. . . .]<hi rend="sup">ths</hi> over. In this
                    (no more than in the first) are scarce any conspicuous Glands; so that it may be called, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Perspicuum</hi>. </p>
                <p>The Third, of the length of the Second; and somewhat less in Diametre. The Vessels of This, are more numerous than of the
                    former. And 'tis furnish'd with several large Clusters of Glands, about nine or ten: some of them an inch and 1/[. . . .],
                    two or three inches long; and &#x00BC;, or &#x00BD; an inch over. And may be call'd <hi rend="italic">Minus
                    Glandosum</hi>. </p>
                <p>The Fourth, is a yard and &#x00BC; long; where widest, as the Third; but the greatest part of it not above [. . . .]/[. . .
              .]<hi rend="sup">ths</hi> of an inch. This Gut, instead of Clusters, is Lined with a Glandulous Lace, extended from
                    one end to the other. At the beginning &#x00BC; of an inch broad; at the end next the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>,
                    &#x00BC; of an inch. Spread or extended (as was first observed of the Glandulous Clusters) upon that side of the Gut, as
                    is directly opposite to the Insertions of the Vessels. The other part of the Circuit of the Gut, is very thin and
                    perspicuous. This Gut may be called <hi rend="italic">Magis Glandosum</hi>. </p>
                <p>The extremity of this Gut, doth not only joyn to the <hi rend="italic">Colon</hi>, but is inserted into it, and therein <hi
              rend="italic">protuberant:</hi> very like, in shape and bigness to the Nipple of a Womans Breast that gives suck: and
                    is likewise punched in several places at the top and round about with the <hi rend="italic">Orifices</hi> of so many
                    several Glands. </p>
                <p>The Fifth, or <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, is four inches long, and an inch and &#x00BC; over. Among all the <hi
              rend="italic">Quadrupeds</hi> I have open'd, peculiar to This and the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi> of a <hi
              rend="italic">Horse</hi> to have the same structure with the <hi rend="italic">Colon</hi>. </p>
                <p>The Sixth, or <hi rend="italic">Colon</hi>, is &#x00BC; of a yard long. Where it joyns to the <hi rend="italic"
              >C&#x00E6;cum</hi> an inch over; from which place it tapers all along to the other end, where it is not above &#x00BD;
                    an inch over. Gather'd up into several Cells from end to end, with two opposite Ligaments, as in a <hi rend="italic"
              >Rabbit</hi>. At the top of it, just under the abovesaid Nipple, is a large round Cluster of Glands with very fair <hi
              rend="italic">Orifices</hi>. </p>
                <p>Of all the <hi rend="italic">Quadrupeds</hi> I have open'd, peculiar to this Animal, a <hi rend="italic">Horse</hi>, and a
              <hi rend="italic">Coney</hi> (perhaps also an <hi rend="italic">Ass</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">Hare</hi>) to have a
                    true <hi rend="italic">Colon:</hi> if that of a Man be the standard for the Definition of it. </p>
                <p>The Last, or <hi rend="italic">Stercoraceum</hi>, is also [. . . .]/4 of a yard long. Scarce any where more than [. . .
                    .]/[. . . .] an inch over; and towards the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi>, not so much. Whereas in most <hi rend="italic"

                    <hi rend="italic">Haverdupoise</hi>) about an inch and &#x00BC; over: which with respect to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Panch</hi> is but small. Composed of several Organical Parts: which because they are here, as well as in some other
                larger Animals, more conspicuous, I shall somewhat more particularly describe them. </p>
            <p>They are all of them, by <hi rend="italic">Anatomists</hi>, usually, but improperly called <hi rend="italic">Coats:</hi> for
                the inermost, are the chief Body of the <hi rend="italic">Gulet:</hi> So that 'tis the same, as to call the Wood of a hollow
                Plant, one of its Coats. 'Tis therefore composed of Five Membranes; Three in the middle, lined with a Fourth, and faced with a
                Fifth. </p>
            <p>The Utmost, and the Inmost, are both Cuticular. The Inmost, or <hi rend="italic">Glandulata</hi>, exceeding white, and very
                friable: answerable to the outward Rind of the Root of a Plant. </p>
            <p>The next to it, is the Nervous. Which here, and in some other Voraceous Animals, is so very thick, that it may more properly
                be called the <hi rend="italic">CORPUS NERVOSVM</hi>. Composed of <hi rend="italic">Fibers</hi>, partly running by the length
                of the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi>, and in part <hi rend="italic">tranversly</hi> to the two Muscular Membranes. Throughout
                the length of it, run many small Nerves, like the finest <hi rend="italic">Lawn-Thread</hi>. </p>
            <p>This <hi rend="italic">Corpus Nervosum</hi>, is, as I conceive the <hi rend="italic">TENDON</hi> to the two next or Muscular
                Membranes. </p>
            <p>These Two (they are at least two) are truly Muscular. <hi rend="italic">Stenon</hi> hath observed them to be spirally
                continu'd: which of some of them is true, not of all. And Dr. <hi rend="italic">Willis</hi> saith also truly, That they <hi
                    rend="italic">Decussate</hi>, the one winding from the right hand downwards, the other from the left. But, to proceed
                where these two accurate Persons have left; of the admirable Texture of these two Muscules, it is further observable, That of
                each parcel of <hi rend="italic">Fibers</hi>, one half is so distributed, as those <hi rend="italic">Fibers</hi> which belong
                to the uppermost Muscule on the right hand, are in their progress towards the left, cast into that which lies underneath. And
                so on the contrary, those which belong to the Upmost on the left hand, are cast, into that which lies underneath on the right:
                both together making a perfect Plat, somewhat like to that in a <hi rend="italic">Riding-Whip</hi>. The other half keeps
                always above, and is continu'd by a compounded line, partly <hi rend="italic">Spiral</hi>, and partly <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elliptick</hi>; especially towards and at the bottom of the <hi rend="italic">Gula</hi>. </p>
            <p>The Stomachs or Venters in a <hi rend="italic">Sheep</hi> are Four. The First, or <hi rend="italic">Panch</hi>, consisteth of
                as many Membranes as the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi>. The Inmost and the next, <hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. the Nervous, are
                raised up, and made all over rough with a multitude of small Nervous and pointed Knots, in some places smaller and round; in
                other larger and flat: all very like those upon the Tongue. </p>
            <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Panch</hi> also are several <hi rend="italic">Gibbosities</hi>, caused chiefly by the doublings and
                thickness of the Muscular Membranes, in those places. So that they are as it were the <hi rend="italic">Tendons</hi> of the
                said Membranes. </p>
            <p>The Second <hi rend="italic">Venter</hi>, is by the <hi rend="italic">Latins</hi> called <hi rend="italic">Recticulum</hi>. In
                which are the like Nervous Knots, as in the <hi rend="italic">Panch</hi>, but smaller. And comprehended within several round
                Ridges or Plates composed together in the form of a <hi rend="italic">Net</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Honey-Coome</hi>. </p>
            <p>The Third, is called the <hi rend="italic">Omasus:</hi> by <hi rend="italic">Butchers</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Feck</hi>. Of
                a wonderful structure: being divided into above 40 Receptacles by so many Sepiments, great and small: some &#x00BC;, &#x00BD;,
                or &#x00BC; of an inch, others an inch, or two inches broad. All cover'd with the like Knots, as the two former <hi
                    rend="italic">Venters</hi>; but extream small. </p>
            <p>The Fourth <hi rend="italic">Venter</hi> is called <hi rend="italic">Abomasus:</hi> by <hi rend="italic">Butchers</hi>, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Read</hi>. The only analogous one to that in a Man; the Membranes hereof being all alike. Saving, That the
                Plates (as here they are rather than Folds) are far deeper; and oppositely and regularly mett in an oblique posture. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Guts</hi> are Six or Eight. The length of all, near 32 yards. The First, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Serpentine</hi>, from its Flexures, about &#x00BD; a yard long, and &#x00BE; of an inch over. </p>
            <p>The Second, or <hi rend="italic">Jejunum</hi>, about 13 yards and &#x00BD;, and as wide as the first. </p>
            <p>The Third, or <hi rend="italic">Ileum</hi>, 11 yards long; and an inch over. </p>
            <p>The Fourth, or <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, above a Foot in length; and where widest, two inches and [. . . .]/[. . .
                .]. </p>
            <p>The Fifth, is continu'd from the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi> without either Valve or Contraction intervening. Above a
                yard long; and an inch and &#x00BC; where narrowest. </p>
            <p>The Last, may by way of Eminence, be called the <hi rend="italic">Muscular:</hi> being as thick as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gulet</hi> it self. And This may be subdivided into Three. From the Fifth, it grows small to the length of an Eln; where
                it is &#x00BD; an inch over. Of this width it continues two Elns more and [. . . .]/[. . . .]. After it widens again, to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi> or the length of another Eln and [. . . .]/[. . . .]; where 'tis near an inch and &#x00BE;
                wide. In the <hi rend="italic">Jejunum</hi>, the Vessels are less numerous; in the <hi rend="italic">Ileum</hi>, more; in the
                    <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, and the next, most; and in the Muscular, least. </p>
            <p>The Glands, not so observable, as in those of a <hi rend="italic">Calf</hi>, which I shall next describe. </p>
            <div>
                <head>A Calf. </head>
                <p>The Number, Shape, and Texture of the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Venters</hi> of a CALF, are the
                    same, as of a <hi rend="italic">Sheep</hi>. The Guts much different. In length, about 20 yards. In a well grown <hi
              rend="italic">Ox</hi>, at least thrice as long. Asking a <hi rend="italic">Butcher</hi>, at his <hi rend="italic"
              >Slaughter-House</hi>, How long he thought they might be; he guessed 30 yards. But believing him mistaken, I caused
                    them to be measur'd, and found them full 60 yards, and four over, which may be allowed for their stretching, for that they
                    were measur'd empty. </p>
                <p>They may be reckon'd seven or nine. The First, the <hi rend="italic">Serpentinum</hi>, as in a <hi rend="italic"
              >Sheep</hi>. In length &#x00BD; a yard, and &#x00BC; of an inch wide. </p>
                <p>The Second, or <hi rend="italic">Amplum</hi> (being the widest of all the rest but the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>)
                    is five yards and &#x00BD; long; and an inch and [. . . .]/4 broad. These two are very thin, and have scarce any
                    conspicuous Glands. </p>
                <p>The Third, or <hi rend="italic">Magis Glandosum</hi>, near seven yards long, and an inch wide. Furnished with a great many
                    Clusters of Glands, like those in a <hi rend="italic">Pig</hi>, about 50 of them; an inch &#x00BC;, or &#x00BD; long, and
                    some longer. </p>
                <p>The Fourth, or <hi rend="italic">Gracillimum</hi>, about two yards long; and not above &#x00BD; an inch over. Whereas in a
              <hi rend="italic">Sheep</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Guts</hi> next the <hi rend="italic">Venters</hi>, and that
                    following, are near of one width. Somewhat thicker and more fleshy than any of the former. Hath several Clusters of large
                    Glands; but nothing near so many, no not with respect to its length, as the precedent: and may therefore be also called
              <hi rend="italic">Minus Glandosum</hi>. </p>
                <p>The Fifth, or <hi rend="italic">Maxim Glandosum</hi>, is a yard and &#x00BC; long, and an inch wide. By far the most
                    opacous, thick and ponderous of all the five. Lined throughout the length, with such a Glandulous Lace, as in a <hi
              rend="italic">Pig</hi>. This Lace is thicker than all the other Parts of the Gut together. At the beginning [. . .
                    .]/2 an inch, at the lower end an inch broad. The rest of the Gut, over which this is not spread, is perspicuous. </p>
                <p>The Sixth, or <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, near two feet long, and above two inches and &#x00BC; over where widest;
                    where narrowest, an inch. Very thin, and without any considerable Glands. </p>
                <p>The Last, or <hi rend="italic">Musculare</hi>, two yards and &#x00BD; long, and of the same Diametre in its several parts
                    as in a <hi rend="italic">Sheep</hi>; being wide at both ends, and slender in the middle: and may therefore, as that, be
                    subdivided into three. </p>

            <head>And first of the Gulet. </head>
            <p>IN speaking hereof, I shall, as in the Anatomical Part, insist chiefly on those Particulars which have been omitted by others. </p>
            <p>It may therefore first be noted of the bore of the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi>, That it is not every where alike answerable to
                the Body or Stomach. As in a <hi rend="italic">Fox</hi>, which both feeds on Bones, and swallows whole, or with little
                chewing; and next in a <hi rend="italic">Dog</hi>, and other Ossivorous <hi rend="italic">Quadrupeds</hi>, 'tis very large;
                    <hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. to prevent a contusion therein. Next in a <hi rend="italic">Horse</hi>; which though he feeds
                on <hi rend="italic">Grass</hi>, yet swallows much at once, and so requires a more open passage. But in a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sheep, Rabbit</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Ox</hi>, which bite short, and swallow less at once, 'tis smaller. But in a <hi
                    rend="italic">Squirel</hi>, still lesser, both because he eats fine, and to keep him from disgorging his meat upon his
                descending leaps. And so in <hi rend="italic">Rats</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mice</hi>, which often run along Walls with
                their Heads downward. </p>
            <p>The Thickness of the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi> is also different. So in a <hi rend="italic">Weesle</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Pole-Cat</hi>, which eat no Bones, more Membranous or Skiny. In <hi rend="italic">Dogs</hi> more Muscular,
                greater force being required to carry down Bones, than Flesh. But in <hi rend="italic">Sheep, Hogs, Cows, Horses</hi> most of
                all; for three Reasons: First, For that <hi rend="italic">Grass</hi>, and especially <hi rend="italic">Hay</hi> is less
                slippery, and apt to clog by the way. Secondly, Because they eat continually, and so the Gulet is in continual action, which
                it could not bear without pain, were it not made sturdy for hard labour: in like manner, as are the Muscules of the Chaps, and
                especially the <hi rend="italic">Masseter</hi>, in all the said Animals. Thirdly, For that all they eat and drink (because
                they hold their Heads down) must be made by a greater force to <hi rend="italic">ascend</hi> into their Stomachs. Whereas in
                Carnivorous Animals, and especially a Man, it passeth by descent. And there are few, but may remember, how difficult it was,
                when they were Boys, to drink with their Heads down at a Spring. And although <hi rend="italic">Dogs</hi> drink with their
                Heads down, yet they can only <hi rend="italic">Lap</hi>, their Gulet not being Muscular enough to <hi rend="italic">carry
                    up</hi> much at once. </p>
            <p>The several Parts of the Gulet, have their distinct Uses. The outer Membrane, is both a Fence, and a Swath to all the rest;
                especially to the Muscular. For the Nervous underneath, being always capable of, and sometimes subject to inordinate
                expansions (as Dr. <hi rend="italic">Willis</hi> doth well conjecture) it would Rack the Muscular Membranes beyond their Tone,
                were they not bound up within this. </p>
            <p>The two Musculars, chiefly subserve the several Motions of the Gulet. Amongst which, Dr. <hi rend="italic">Willis</hi> reckons
                Oscitation or Yauning, and Expuition. Of the first, [Note: Pharmac. Ration, P. 1.] his words are these; <hi rend="italic">In
                    Oscitatione, &#x0153;sophagi ductum ampliari, &amp; quasi a vento quodam inflari &amp; expandi sentimus</hi>. But who
                knows not, that the <hi rend="italic">Windpipe</hi>, and not the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi>, is the part concern'd in all
                kinds of Respiration, where of <hi rend="italic">Oscitation</hi> is one. Of the latter, his words are these; [Note: Ibid.] <hi
                    rend="italic">Gul&#x00E6; Tunica carnosa, duplex quasi Musculus censeri debet; quorum alter, expuitionis opus
                    persicit</hi>. At that time forgeting, that no man ever spat any thing out of his Stomach; no more than he can be said to
                vomit or eructate out of his Mouth. The Doctor is one, of whom I have learned much: and therefore I mention these Things, only
                because they lie in my way: and that we may still remember, <hi rend="italic">Nullius in Verba</hi>. </p>
            <p>The Actions of the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi> are therefore principally these Three, <hi rend="italic">Deglutition,
                    Vomition</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Eructation</hi>. By one of the Muscular Membranes, saith the forementioned Doctor,
                    <hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. that which descends, <hi rend="italic">Deglutition</hi> is performed; by the ascendent, <hi
                    rend="italic">Vomition</hi>. His words [Note: Ibid.] are these, <hi rend="italic">C<seg>??</seg>m unius Fibrarum ordo
                    descendens, Deglutitioni inserviat; alter ascendens, Vomitionis opus persicit</hi>. But that he was herein mistaken, I
                conceive, appears from the structure of the said Membranes, neither of which, is ascendent or descendent, more than the other;
                and from the manner of their Contexture, as is above describ'd. Besides, if it were so, why should there not be <hi
                    rend="italic">Ascendent</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Descendent Fibers</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Muscules</hi>, for the
                Natural, and the Inverted Motions also of the <hi rend="italic">Guts?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I conceive therefore, That <hi rend="italic">Deglutition</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vomition</hi> are made by the Cooperation
                of both the said Membranes: only in the former, the Motion g&#x0153;s from the Throat downward, in the latter, from the
                Stomach upward. And so in <hi rend="italic">Eructation</hi>, only with less force. For the performance of which Actions, Two
                Muscules or Muscular Membranes are yet requisite; and those platted and interchanged, as hath been describ'd: That is, by a
                double Plat of the <hi rend="italic">Fibers</hi> of both; whereby half the nether Membrane on the one side the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gulet</hi>, becomes half the upper Membrane on the other side: and so <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>, in
                spiral rounds throughout. To the end, That the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi> being hereby contracted in one part, and dilated
                in the next, might at the same time, thrust forward, and let pass, any body therein contain'd: and that the said <hi
                    rend="italic">Contractions</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dilatations</hi> might be more easily and regularly made, and by
                reciprocal <hi rend="italic">Undulations</hi>, carry'd on from one end of the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi> to the other. These
                    <hi rend="italic">Undulations</hi>, in the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">Horse</hi>, when he drinks,
                are very plainly seen. </p>
            <p>And that this <hi rend="italic">Undulation</hi> may be made with more speed, it is observable, That the said <hi rend="italic"
                    >Muscular Fibers</hi> are not continu'd by a close, but very oblique or open spiral Line. Whereby, as the spiral Rounds or
                Circuits, so the <hi rend="italic">Undulations</hi>, are the fewer; and consequently, not slowly (as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Guts</hi>) but much sooner finished. </p>
            <p>Hence it is, That a <hi rend="italic">Cat</hi> hath so difficult a swallow, the meat commonly seeming to stick in her Throat.
                Not from the smallness of her <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi>; but for that in the longer half of it, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Muscular Fibers</hi> are continu'd in so close a spiral Line, as rather to seem <hi rend="italic">Annular</hi>. Whereby,
                the <hi rend="italic">Undulations</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi> are more slowly and difficultly made. So that a
                more difficult swallow, being one thing necessary to make her not greedy, but patiently to watch for her Prey; Nature hath
                therefore contriv'd her <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi> for that purpose. </p>
            <p>The Nervous Membrane, or (as in some <hi rend="italic">Graminivorous Animals</hi> it may be call'd) <hi rend="italic">Corpus
                    Nervosum</hi>, hath hitherto been thought to serve only for sense. Dr. <hi rend="italic">Willis</hi> Conjectures, That it
                is also the Instrument of some certain motions of expansion in <hi rend="italic">Oscitation</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Preternatural Inflation:</hi> which is all he saith. </p>
            <p>But to Me, it seemeth, That it Cooperates with the Muscular Membrane to all the Natural Motions of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gulet</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">Deglutition, Vomition</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Eructation</hi>. And, to speak
                properly, That 'tis nothing else but a HOLLOW TENDON; that is, the <hi rend="italic">Tendon</hi> of the two Muscular
                Membranes. </p>
            <p>It may be Objected, That then it should lie above, not under the Membranes. But in a <hi rend="italic">Gizard</hi>, we find the
                    <hi rend="italic">Tendon</hi> spread within or underneath the Fleshy part of the Muscules, as well as above. </p>
            <p>The truth of this will further appear, if we consider the great Thickness of this Membrane, where the most forceable motions of
                the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi> are required. For it would serve as well for sensation, if it were ten times as thin: the
                grossness of the sensory, not being necessary to the exquisiteness of the sense; but of the mover, always to the strength of
                the motion. And therefore, whereas the <hi rend="italic">Cuticular</hi> or utmost Membrane is much of the same thickness in
                all Animals; the Nervous is much varied according to the thinness or thickness of the Muscular: that is, where the Muscule is
                thick, the <hi rend="italic">Tendon</hi> is proportionable. The notice of which in <hi rend="italic">Oxen, &amp;c</hi>.
                sheweth the same use hereof in a man. </p>
            <p>The Inmost Skin or Lining of the <hi rend="italic">Gula</hi>, is to be a protection to the Nervous, as the outer is to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Muscular</hi>; that so nothing hard, salt, sower, or any way acrimonious, may be injurious to it. To keep it
                the better within bounds, in all the motions of the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi>. To be the Bed of the Glands. And one seat of
                Thirst; which oftentimes lies no deeper than the Throat and upper part of the <hi rend="italic">Gulet:</hi> and is cured by
                any thing which by moistening the Throat shall give vent to the <hi rend="italic">Mucus stagnant</hi> therein. </p>

            <head><hi rend="italic">CHAP. VI</hi>. Of the Uses of the Stomachs of Quadrupeds.</head>
            <p>ANd first, all <hi rend="italic">Carnivorous Quadrupeds</hi> have the smallest <hi rend="italic">Ventricles</hi>; flesh going
                farthest. Those that feed on Fruits and Roots have them of a middle size. Yet the <hi rend="italic">Mole</hi>, because It
                feeds unclean, hath a very great one. <hi rend="italic">Sheep</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oxen</hi>, which feed on <hi
                    rend="italic">Grass</hi>, have the greatest. Yet the <hi rend="italic">Horse</hi> (and for the same reason the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coney</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hare</hi>) though <hi rend="italic">Graminivorous</hi>, yet comparatively
                have but little ones. For that a <hi rend="italic">Horse</hi> is made for labour, and both This and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hare</hi> for quick and continu'd motion: for which, the most easie Respiration, and so the freest motion of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Diaphragme</hi> is very requisite; which yet could not be, should the Stomach lie big and cumbersome upon
                it, as in <hi rend="italic">Sheep</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oxen</hi> it doth. For which cause Nature hath here transfer'd
                the greater part of the <hi rend="italic">Alimental Lugage</hi> into the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>. </p>
            <p>The Neck of the Stomach, near the Gut, is commonly reflected backward, so as to make an acute Angle with the Back of it. To
                the end, the extrusion of the prepared <hi rend="italic">Aliment</hi> to the Gut, may be stinted. And that the thiner part,
                which will more easily wind about, may the better pass away, and leave the rest behind. Sometimes it hath three or four <hi
                    rend="italic">Flexures</hi>, as in <hi rend="italic">Sheep</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oxen:</hi> for that the Gut being so
                small with respect to the <hi rend="italic">Venter</hi>, and with all so very thin; it would, by too sudden or copious an
                irruption of the <hi rend="italic">Aliment</hi>, be in danger of being burst. And for the same reasons, the Stomach of a <hi
                    rend="italic">Pig</hi>, so voraceous a Creature, is also furnished with a Stopple. </p>
            <p>The distinct uses of the Parts of the Stomach, are many of them the same as of the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi>. I shall not
                therefore repeat, but proceed to those particulars as remain to be explicated. </p>
            <p>And first, 'tis plain, in those thick Stomachs of an <hi rend="italic">Ox</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">Sheep</hi>, that the
                carneous Membranes are true <hi rend="italic">Muscules:</hi> which conducteth us more easily to believe that of a man also <hi
                    rend="italic">Muscular</hi>. 'Tis certain, that the <hi rend="italic">Muscules</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Abdomen</hi>
                in some Animals, as in <hi rend="italic">Squirels</hi>, are thiner than those of a mans Stomach. </p>
            <p>Now the Nervous and Muscular Parts joyntly subserve to all the motions of the Stomach, which I reckon five, <hi rend="italic"
                    >viz. Corrugation, Astriction, Undulation, Convulsion</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Voluntary Motion</hi>. </p>
            <p>
                <hi rend="italic">Corrugation</hi>, is when there is a double motion of Contraction, beginning from both the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orifices</hi> of the Stomach, and so drawing it up into innumerable small Wrinkles. For the better expression of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mucus</hi> out of the <hi rend="italic">Glands</hi> of the inner Membrane. For a closer comprehension of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Aliment</hi>, and immission of the said <hi rend="italic">Mucus</hi> or other fermenting Juyce, into it.
                And for the gradual expression of the colliquated parts thereof into the Gut. In this motion, the utmost <hi rend="italic"
                    >Muscular Fibers</hi> contract the Stomach in length; and the inermost, in breadth. </p>
            <p>
                <hi rend="italic">Astriction</hi>, is a Contraction only about the <hi rend="italic">Pylorus</hi>; performed by the inermost
                    <hi rend="italic">Fibers</hi> alone. For the firmer Retention of the <hi rend="italic">Aliment</hi>, and its orderly
                dismission into the Gut. </p>
            <p>
                <hi rend="italic">Undulation</hi>, is when the Contraction is made in several parts of the Stomach successively, beginning at
                one <hi rend="italic">Orifice</hi>, or End, and terminating at the opposite. Made also by the Inner <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fibers</hi>; after the same manner, as the <hi rend="italic">Undulation</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Peristaltick
                    Motion</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Guts</hi>. The use of it, is either for <hi rend="italic">Excretion</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Eructation</hi>. If it begins from the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi>, it serves, after the finest of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aliment</hi> is discharg'd by <hi rend="italic">Corrugation</hi>, for Excretion of the rest. But if the <hi
                    rend="italic">Undulation</hi> be Inverted, or begins from the <hi rend="italic">Pylorus</hi>, it produceth <hi
                    rend="italic">Eructation</hi>. Answering to the like Inverted Motion, which sometimes happens in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Guts</hi>. </p>
            <p>
                <hi rend="italic">Convulsion</hi>, is a forcible and suddain Contraction of all the Orders of <hi rend="italic">Fibers</hi>,
                outer, middle, and inmost. The use hereof with <hi rend="italic">Undulation</hi>, is for <hi rend="italic">Vomition</hi>. For
                first, there is only an Inverted <hi rend="italic">Undulation</hi>, that is, I conceive, when there is only a <hi
                    rend="italic">Naucea</hi> or tendency to Vomit. Which <hi rend="italic">Undulation</hi> also, carries part of the matter
                by degrees, to the upper mouth of the Stomach. And growing quicker and stronger, at last turns into a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Convulsion</hi>; the Stomach being hereby contracted both in width and length, and the <hi rend="italic">Pylorus</hi>
                forced up to the upper <hi rend="italic">Orifice</hi> (as a <hi rend="italic">Barbars Puff</hi> in powdering the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hair</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic">Bladder</hi> in the Injection of a Clyster) and so produceth actual <hi
                    rend="italic">Vomition</hi>. </p>
            <p>
                <hi rend="italic">The Voluntary Motion of the Stomach</hi>, is that only which accompanies <hi rend="italic">Rumination</hi>.
                That it is truly voluntary, is clear, from the Command that Ruminating Animals have of that Action. For this purpose it is,
                that the <hi rend="italic">Muscules</hi> of their <hi rend="italic">Venters</hi> are so thick and strong; and have several <hi
                    rend="italic">Duplicatures</hi> as the Bases of those <hi rend="italic">Muscules</hi>, whereupon the stress of their
                motion lies. By means whereof, they are able with ease to rowl and tumble any part of the meat from one Cell of the same
                Venter to another, or from one Venter to another, or from thence into the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi>, whens&#x0153;ver they
                are minded to do it. So that the Ejection of the meat in Rumination, is a <hi rend="italic">Voluntary Eructation</hi>. Not at
                all laborious to them, because of the great strength of the Muscules of their Stomach and Gulet to command and govern the
                same. </p>
            <p>By the Joynt assistance of the Glandulous and the Nervous Membranes, the business of <hi rend="italic">Chylification</hi>
                seems to be perform'd. The <hi rend="italic">Mucous</hi> Excrement of the Blood being supply'd by the former, as an Animal <hi
                    rend="italic">Corrosive</hi>, preparing; and the Excrement of the Nerves by the latter, as an Animal Ferment, perfecting
                the Work. And the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cus Ventriculus</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">Hog</hi>, seems to be a <hi
                    rend="italic">Repository</hi> provided for such a mixed <hi rend="italic">Leven</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Menstruum:</hi>
                whereby he not only becomes more voraceous, having thence continual irritations to eat: but all he eats, is thereby likewise
                well digested. </p>
            <p>The Folds of the Stomach, which in its <hi rend="italic">Corrugation</hi> must needs be much deeper than when it is dilated,
                or of use, To divide the <hi rend="italic">Aliment</hi> into several Portions, and thereby administer their Ferments not only
                to the Circumference, but intimate parts of the Mass to be fermented. </p>
            <p>The pointed Knots, like little <hi rend="italic">Papill&#x00E6;</hi>, in the Stomachs of divers Ruminating Beasts, are also of
                great use, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. For the Tasting of the Meat. Dr. <hi rend="italic">Willis</hi> describing the Inner
                Membrane of the Stomach (not of a Beast, but expresly of a Man) speaketh thus; <hi rend="italic">H&#x00E6;c Crusta
                    Ventriculum</hi> (Humanum puta) <hi rend="italic">intus obtegens, similis videtur Illi, qu&#x00E6; Linguam obtegit</hi>.
                Wherein he was mistaken: this Inner Membrane being Glandulous; the Skin of the Tongue not so, but only Fibrous. But of divers
                Beasts which Ruminate, thus much is true, That in their Three first Venters, the Inner Membrane is Fibrous, and not
                Glandulous; the fourth only being Glandulous, as in a man. Of the Fibers of this Membrane and the Nervous, are composed those
                pointed Knots before described [Note: Chap. 4.] both in substance and shape, altogether like to those upon the Tongue. Whence
                I doubt not, but that the said Three <hi rend="italic">Ventricles</hi>, as they have a power of <hi rend="italic">Voluntary
                    Motion:</hi> so likewise, that they are the <hi rend="italic">Seat</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Tast</hi>, and as truly the
                    <hi rend="italic">Organs</hi> of that sense, as is the Tongue it self. </p>
            <p>Lastly, and consequently, the said Nervous Knots, are of use to Methodize the Work of <hi rend="italic">Rumination</hi>, after
                this manner. The Animal having eaten enough for the <hi rend="italic">Panch</hi> well to govern; rowles and tumbles the meat
                to and fro therein: and at the same time, with the help of the said Nervous Knots of several degrees of fineness (as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Goldsmith</hi> hath his <hi rend="italic">Assayers</hi> of several degrees of niceness) judges of the
                Courseness or Fineness, Crudeness, or Concoction of any part of it; and accordingly lets it rest, or removes it. So then the
                grossest of these <hi rend="italic">Assayers</hi> standing about the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi>, and so in the passage of
                the meat between the <hi rend="italic">Panch</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Reticulum</hi>, being the proper judges of what is
                Course or Crude; if they find it so, then 'tis tumbled back to receive a further maturation in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Panch</hi>. If somewhat fine and Concocted, 'tis then permitted to pass on and rowl into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reticulum</hi>. And the said <hi rend="italic">Assayers</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Nervous Knobs</hi> being here sharper
                and softer, than in the <hi rend="italic">Panch</hi>; have still a more accurate Tast: and therefore what they yet find too
                course, the <hi rend="italic">Reticulum</hi> forthwith throws it up into the Gulet and Mouth. From whence, being further
                refined, 'tis remanded to the <hi rend="italic">Reticulum</hi>; and thence after a while, into the Third Stomach or the <hi
                    rend="italic">Omasus</hi>. And This again being a more nice <hi rend="italic">Assayer</hi> than the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reticulum</hi>; if it feels the meat fine and soft enough, passeth it into the last Stomach or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abomasus</hi>. But if otherwise, throws it back into the <hi rend="italic">Reticulum</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reticulum</hi> into the Gulet and Mouth to be labour'd once again, and so remanded. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
            <head><hi rend="italic">CHAP. VII</hi>. Of the Uses of the Guts of Quadrupeds.</head>
            <p>I Shall here, as before, pass over such particulars as have been spoken of by others; and divers also which being observable
                in the Gulet and Stomachs, as well as here, have been already sufficiently explain'd. </p>
            <p>And first the different Bore of the Guts is observable. So, for example, the Guts of a <hi rend="italic">Horse</hi> are very
                wide. For that he both swalloweth, and dischargeth from his Stomach into his Guts, the meat more gross; which therefore
                requireth a more open passage, lest it should clog. As also, that it may move with greater speed towards the <hi rend="italic"
                    >C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, here, [Note: Chap. 6.] for the reason above-said, design'd by Nature to be a second Stomach. Whereas
                in an <hi rend="italic">Ox</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">Sheep</hi>, the meat having passed four successive Concoctions, 'tis
                thence delivered to the Guts of a much finer substance; and so moveth safe enough throuh a much smaller Chanel; and fast
                enough, there being much less work here left, for the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi> to perform. </p>
            <p>The Contraction also of the Guts, or lessening of the Bore by several Necks, is of good use. As for instance, in an <hi
                    rend="italic">Urchan</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Cat</hi>; serving to stint the Transition of the meat, that it be not over
                quick, and dividing the Guts into so many little <hi rend="italic">Venters</hi>, in which the meat restagnates for some time,
                in order to its reception of as many repeated Concoctions. Whereby also in these Animals the work of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, and therefore the making of it, seems superseded. </p>
            <p>Moreover, the rarious length of the Guts is observable, according to the cleanness, or more fewer nutritive parts of the Food;
                or its colliquability into <hi rend="italic">Chyle</hi>. So in a <hi rend="italic">Weesle</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Squirel</hi>, that feeds much on Eggs, and Nuts, and such like fine and nutritive food, they are extream short. And in
                all Gross eaters, longer than in other <hi rend="italic">Quadrupeds</hi>. And therefore one reason, why the Guts of a Sheep or
                    <hi rend="italic">Ox</hi> are slender, is, that they may be long. For were they shorter and wider, it would not be <hi
                    rend="italic">tantamount:</hi> For the food being <hi rend="italic">Grass</hi>, it is not sufficient that they should hold
                enough: but also necessary, that they give a longer voyage to a substance so jejune, for a thorow solution and exuction of all
                its nutritive parts. Besides, that in a smaller Channel, the said parts will all along lie nearer to the Lacteal Veins, and so
                more easily be express'd into them. </p>
            <p>The Membranes of the Guts, have a general analogy in all <hi rend="italic">Quadrupeds</hi>, and divers of their Uses have been
                well assign'd. I shall therefore only Note, That as the spiral <hi rend="italic">Fibers</hi> contract or purse up the Bore of
                the Gut; so those that run by the length, draw it up shorter, and so dilate it. Whereby, as one part of the Gut may press the
                meat forward, or as it were disgorge it, so another gape to receive it, at the same time. And in case one Gut should by
                another, or by some Bowel, be oppress'd, being by the said Contraction in length removed a little out of its place; the
                freedom of its motion, or any thing therein, will thereby be regain'd. </p>
            <p>But in a <hi rend="italic">Mole</hi>, the same <hi rend="italic">Fibers</hi> which run by the length, being Indented, do also
                for a little way, each parcel obliquely run by the breadth of the Gut. Whereby they are able, without the help of spiral <hi
                    rend="italic">Fibers</hi>, to narrow or shorten the Gut of themselves£ and also to do both in the same place. For by the
                Relaxation of the <hi rend="italic">Fibers</hi>, the sides of every Indenture, must needs grow both wider and more distant,
                and the Gut wider and more extended, at the same time: and so <hi rend="italic">Vice versa</hi>. Probably with this design,
                That the Shells of <hi rend="italic">Insects</hi> may make a more safe transition, without raking against the tender sides of
                the Guts. </p>
            <p>The Glands of the Guts are likewise of great Use. The <hi rend="italic">Mucus</hi> which they spew, serves to make the Guts
                slippery, that the meat may the more easily and fasely glide along. As also for another Ferment superinduc'd to that of the
                Stomach, and so a further colliquation of the meat. With respect to both which Uses, the said Glands, according to the Bore of
                the Guts, the hardness or softness, courseness or colliquability of the meat, are more or less numerous; as in the precedent
                Examples. </p>
            <p>And that this <hi rend="italic">Mucus</hi> may be duly supply'd, Nature still allows <hi rend="italic">Blood-Vessels</hi>
                proportionable to the plenty of Glands. And hath taken care that the Vessels enter not the Guts on the same side on which the
                Glands are seated, but the opposite: that having space enough to branch themselves into the smallest capillary Tubes, before
                they reach the Glands, there may be the less danger, that any sincere Blood should with the <hi rend="italic">Mucus</hi> make
                an Inundation into them. </p>
            <p>Through the same Glands, as so many little Springs, I conceive, That the Humours are either emunged, or precipitated, out of
                the Blood, in Purgation. For that one so small a <hi rend="italic">Pipe</hi>, as that of the <hi rend="italic">Pancreas</hi>
                should bring so great a quantity, is not at all probable. And the Glands being a visible way, I know no reason, wherefore we
                should have recourse to any invisible one. </p>
            <p>Thus the same Glands are a great means to prevent <hi rend="italic">Feavers</hi>, and other ill effects of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cold</hi> by a <hi rend="italic">Diarrhea</hi>. For when by a suddain astriction of the Pores of the Skin, or otherwise,
                the usual perspiration is stop'd: the redundant matter in the Blood, is often safely discharged, by the Glands, into the Guts.
                But if the matter be very sharp, or rusheth upon the Glands too suddainly; it sometimes corrodes or breaks them, and so makes
                way for Blood also: as may be observ'd in the Guts of such as die of a <hi rend="italic">Dysentry</hi>. </p>
            <p>The Use of the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi> is manifold, but divers in divers Animals; according to the make of it, and
                the Relation it bears to the Stomachs and the Guts. And first, for the most part, it serves to give a second Deliberate
                Concoction to the meat, that nothing nutritive in it may be lost. For which purpose, it is always furnish'd with Glands, as
                well as the other Guts. And, with respect to its width, is commonly but thin, or less muscular, that so being less apt to
                constringe it self, it may give a due time of stay to the meat deliver'd to it. For which end also it is placed out of the
                common Road of the Guts; that being thereby less receptive of their <hi rend="italic">Peristaltick Motion</hi>; it may lie the
                more still. For the same intent the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi> in a <hi rend="italic">Sheep</hi> hath several <hi
                    rend="italic">Flexures</hi> answerable to those in the <hi rend="italic">4th</hi> Stomach or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abomasus</hi>. And in a <hi rend="italic">Hog</hi>, 'tis drawn up into Cells on both sides, like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Colon</hi>, to make it so much the more retentive. In the <hi rend="italic">Coney</hi>, the same is done still more
                effectually, by the spiral Plate, or Connivent <hi rend="italic">Valve</hi> winding from end to end. And in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Horse</hi>, not by two only, but four Rows of Cells on the four sides. In which two last Animals the said
                Use is so eminent, that the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, considering its bigness withall, is the chief Stomach, and
                much superior to the <hi rend="italic">Stomach</hi> so call'd. And it is also observable, That the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abomasideus</hi> in a <hi rend="italic">Rat</hi>, hath the same relation to the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>; as
                in a <hi rend="italic">Sheep</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Abomasus</hi> hath to the other Stomachs. Hence likewise it may be,
                that some Animals have little or no <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum:</hi> either because the meat is so dissoluble, as not to
                need a second deliberate Concoction, as in a <hi rend="italic">Weesle</hi>; or for that Nature hath made something else to
                serve without it; as those several Contractions in the Guts of a <hi rend="italic">Cat</hi>; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Valvul&#x00E6; Conniventes</hi> in the small Guts of a Man. Where we may observe, That these <hi rend="italic"
                    >Valves</hi> are not every where spiral, as is thought, but do also make some perfect and distinct Rings: whereby they are
                fitter to retard the motion of the meat in its descent. </p>
            <p>Another Use may be, For a Retreat; Either to the meat, if it should chance to rush too fast into the Gut below it: Or to the
                Excrements, in case the Animal is diverted from a present ejection of them. </p>
            <p>The last Use, I shall name, may be this, That in case the meat, or the Excrements in the lower Guts should be at any time so
                dry and hard, as too slowly, and not without much stress to the Guts, to descend; the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi> is
                as a <hi rend="italic">Clyster-Bag</hi>, always ready with its liquid Content, to be in some part thereinto injected. For
                which purpose, it usually makes an acute angle with the upper Guts, and opens directly into those below it. </p>
            <p>The Make of the Colon, with other Uses, also answers to the greater need of Retention. Either because of the upright posture,
                as in a Man; or frequent and speedy motions, as in a <hi rend="italic">Horse</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Hare:</hi> where,
                without the Cells of the <hi rend="italic">Colon</hi>, to retain the Excrements from the <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, there
                would be a continual <hi rend="italic">Conatus egerendi</hi>. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, or rather <hi rend="italic">Stercoraceum</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">Cat</hi>, being
                peculiarly of so great a bulk; I will conclude with a Conjecture of one Use of it: and that is, To be as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Counter-poise</hi> to her Head: whereby, from what height s&#x0153;ver she falls, she still lights upon her feet. </p>

            <p>BEcause that many particulars will here occur, which are intelligible from the former Descriptions, and have already been
                explain'd; I shall therefore be the shorter. Of about Forty, which I have open'd, I shall describe these Thirteen that follow,
                    <hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. of a <hi rend="italic">Casowary</hi>, an <hi rend="italic">Owl</hi>, a <hi rend="italic"

                    >Reed-Sparrow</hi>, and a <hi rend="italic">House-Swallow:</hi> and figure them all, but those of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cuckow</hi>. With Notes upon others, as I proceed. </p>
            <div>
                <head>Of a Casowary. </head>
                <p>The CASOWARY hath no Crop. But a wider Gulet, I suppose, as well as Guts, than in any other Bird. Far greater than those
                    of an <hi rend="italic">Ostrich</hi>; although the Body be much less. The Gulet, where widest, or near the Throat, about
                    five inches over; next the Stomach, two. Sprinkled with many small Glands, as it is, more or less, in all Birds. </p>
                <p>At the bottom of it, the <hi rend="italic">Echinus</hi>; common to all Birds that I have open'd. But here less conspicuous.
                    The Figure hath not express'd it. It hath always a Lining of much larger Glands than those in the <hi rend="italic"
              >Gulet</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Crop</hi>; commonly of an Oval Figure, and each of them with an open mouth spewing
                    out a <hi rend="italic">Mucus</hi>. </p>
                <p>He hath no Gizard (as hath the <hi rend="italic">Ostrich</hi>); yet a thick Muscular Stomach, as in other Carnivorous
                    Birds. Almost of an Oval shape; and small with respect to the Guts: expressed somewhat too big for the Scale, (as also the
              <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Guts</hi>) in the Figure. The <hi rend="italic">Pylorus</hi>
                    guarded with a kind of <hi rend="italic">Valve</hi>. </p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Guts</hi> not two yards and half long. Beside the two <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;ca</hi>, are three.
                    The larger, next the Stomach: as it is, in almost all other Birds. About three inches and &#x00BD; over, where widest. The
                    smaller, somewhat above two. The <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, the largest, <hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. about four. Much
                    wider than even those of a <hi rend="italic">Horse</hi>, excepting only his <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi> and his
              <hi rend="italic">Colon</hi>. </p>
                <p>He hath two <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;ca</hi>; as have almost all Birds. Yet here very small, about &#x00BD; a foot long,
                    but no thicker than a Womans little Finger. Here, as in all other Birds, making obtuse Angles with the <hi rend="italic"
              >Rectum</hi>. So that what is said of them in Mr. <hi rend="italic">Willughby's Ornithologia,- - -Cum Intestino Recto
              angulos acutos faciunt:</hi> was only a slip of that most accurate Pen. </p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi> is separated from the next above, by a Connivent <hi rend="italic">Valve</hi>. </p>
            </div>
      </div>
      <div>
            <head>Of an Owle. </head>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi> of a young Grey-OWLE, is of an indifferent size. At the bottom of it, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Echinus</hi>. And somewhat more apparent, than in the <hi rend="italic">Casowary</hi>, but less than in most frugivorous
                Birds. </p>
            <p>The Stomach, a middle Thing betwixt that of other Carnivorous Birds, and a <hi rend="italic">Gizard, sc</hi>. a plain Bag, yet
                in the middle somewhat Tendinous. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Guts</hi> in length two feet and &#x00BD;. Three, besides the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;ca</hi>. The
                first or <hi rend="italic">Amplum</hi>, a foot long; and above &#x00BC; of an inch broad. The <hi rend="italic">Gracile</hi>,
                which reacheth to the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;ca</hi>, a foot and three inches; and above<hi rend="sup">&#x00BC;</hi> of an
                inch where narrowest. In this Gut, are 15 or 16 Contractions, like those in a <hi rend="italic">Cat's</hi>, but made longer. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;ca</hi>, four inches and &#x00BD; long. As the <hi rend="italic">Gizard</hi> of a middle Nature,
                so these of a middle size, betwixt those of some Carnivorous, and some <hi rend="italic">Frugivorous Birds</hi>. At their
                close or further ends, &#x00BD; an inch over. But where they enter the <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, no thicker than the
                bigest string of a <hi rend="italic">Trebel Vial</hi>. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, three inches long; towards the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi>, near an inch wide; almost in the
                Figure of a little <hi rend="italic">Pear</hi>. As it is also in most <hi rend="italic">Wild-Fowl</hi>. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
            <head>Of a young Cuckow. </head>
            <p>Neither hath this Bird any Crop, nor a Gizard. But to the Gulet it is peculiar, That it hath Ten or Twelve Rows of more
                conspicuous Glands, which run along from the Throat to the <hi rend="italic">Echinus</hi>. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Echinus</hi>, of a ratable bigness, and more distinct from the Stomach, than in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Owle</hi>; being divided from it by a <hi rend="italic">Muscular Neck</hi>. As it is also in most other Birds. </p>
            <p>The Stomach, a plain Bag, much like to that of an <hi rend="italic">Owle</hi>; yet somewhat thicker, and more Tendinous. </p>
            <p>The Guts about a foot and &#x00BD; long. Three besides the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;ca</hi>. The first, an inch and &#x00BC;
                long; and near &#x00BC; of an inch wide. The second, above a foot, and <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> wide. The
                    <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;ca</hi>, as wide in the middle, as the first; and above an inch long. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rectum</hi>, two inches and &#x00BD;. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Wild-Duck</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Teal</hi> also, and I suppose all of this kind, and most other
                Birds, are without a Crop. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
            <head>Of a Dunghill-Cock. </head>
            <p>A DUNGHILL-COCK, hath one Stomach or Ventricle more than the former Birds, <hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. a Crop: all over
                besprinkled with small Glands, somewhat more visible than in the Gulet. </p>
            <p>The upper part of the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi>, leading to the <hi rend="italic">Crop</hi>, &#x00BC; of an inch over. But
                the lower part, leading from it towards the <hi rend="italic">Echinus</hi>, very slender, not above &#x00BC; wide. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Echinus</hi> almost an Oval shape, being divided from the Gizard by a pretty long and slender Neck. And
                may therefore be properly call'd the <hi rend="italic">Second</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Oval Ventricle</hi>. </p>
            <p>The Third, is the <hi rend="italic">Gizard</hi>, in the place of the plain Bag or Stomach in the former Birds. 'Tis made of Six
                    <hi rend="italic">Muscules</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">Cartilaginous Lining</hi> in the greater Concave; which may be
                called the <hi rend="italic">Laboratory</hi>. Those four, which make the greatest part of the <hi rend="italic">Gizard</hi>,
                may be called the <hi rend="italic">Grinders</hi>. Of extraordinary thickness; whereby the length of the Convex, is cross to
                the length of the Concave of the <hi rend="italic">Gizard</hi>. Yet thinner towards the Edges, so as to make a kind of double
                    <hi rend="italic">Hyperbola</hi>. In the Centre hereof on both sides meet the <hi rend="italic">Tendons</hi> of the said
                    <hi rend="italic">Muscules</hi>, continued or expanded for about &#x00BD; an inch in breadth, without any Carneous or Red
                    <hi rend="italic">Fibers</hi> mixed with them. From whence, they are divided, the one, which is the stronger, spread over,
                the other, under the <hi rend="italic">Muscules</hi>; into which they are also branched all the way, so as meeting in the body
                of the <hi rend="italic">Muscule</hi> they make a sort of fine Cancellated Work, as may be seen better in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gizard</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">Goose</hi>; especially in a thin slice hereof parboyl'd, and held up
                against a <hi rend="italic">Candle</hi>. And in all <hi rend="italic">Gizards</hi>, so as to be seen to run cross, as in that
                of a <hi rend="italic">Pullet</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Tab</hi>. 29. </p>
            <p>The Fifth <hi rend="italic">Muscule</hi> is that which standeth between the <hi rend="italic">Echinus</hi> and the four <hi
                    rend="italic">Muscules</hi> now describ'd, and may be called the <hi rend="italic">Deductor</hi>, from the use hereafter
                mention'd. Very thin with respect to the former; placed at the upper end of the left edge of the <hi rend="italic"
                >Gizard</hi>, and spread a little on the side, but not so much as in the Figure. Better represented, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tab</hi>. 29. </p>
            <p>The Sixth, is such another <hi rend="italic">Muscule</hi>, standing opposite to the former, <hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. on the
                right edge of the <hi rend="italic">Gizard</hi>, and may be called the <hi rend="italic">Reductor</hi>, as shall be shew'd
                why. </p>
            <p>The four <hi rend="italic">Grinders</hi> are strengthened within, not only with a <hi rend="italic">Tendon</hi>, but a Gristly
                Lining, thicker than the outer <hi rend="italic">Tendon</hi>, with a rough surface, and wrinkled into several <hi
                    rend="italic">Transverse Furrows</hi>, from one end to the other. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Guts</hi> are about a yard and &#x00BD; long. Three besides the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;ca</hi>. The
                first, the smaller; contrary to what it is in most Birds. Not much above &#x00BC; of an inch, where widest. About two feet and
                &#x00BD; long. Where it joyns with the Greater, stands the end of the <hi rend="italic">Ductus Intestinalis</hi>, accurately
                described [Note: Lib. de F&#x0153;tu Formato.] by Dr. <hi rend="italic">Walter Needham</hi>. </p>
            <p>The Greater, where widest &#x00BD; an inch. The <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, somewhat more. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >C&#x00E6;ca</hi> near eight inches long: at the further end, above &#x00BC; of an inch over; but where they open into the
                    <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, no thicker than the great string of a <hi rend="italic">Base-Viol</hi>. </p>
            <p>'Tis proper to the <hi rend="italic">Gallinaceous kind</hi>, to have a great <hi rend="italic">Gizard</hi>. That of a good big
                    <hi rend="italic">Turkey</hi>, near eight Ounces <hi rend="italic">Troy</hi>. Whereas that of a <hi rend="italic">Japan
                    Peacock</hi> is not above two: yet the Body about half as big as that of the <hi rend="italic">Turkey</hi>. </p>
            <p>Not only all the <hi rend="italic">Gallinaceous kind</hi>; but the <hi rend="italic">Duck</hi>, and, I suppose, all of that
                kind, have two very long <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;ca</hi>. </p>

            <head>Of a Tame Pigeon. </head>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi> of a Tame PIGEON, near the Throat, very wide; almost an inch and &#x00BD; over. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Crop</hi> is above three inches broad; above two, long; and an inch and &#x00BE; deep. Not so distinct
                from the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi>, as in the <hi rend="italic">Gallinaceous kind</hi>; this and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gulet</hi> running one into another in a direct Line. In the Belly of it, are few visible Glands: but the Neck thence
                down to the <hi rend="italic">Echinus</hi>, is curiously Lined with six or seven Glandulous Laces. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Crop</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">Carrier-Pigeon</hi>, is curiously shap'd; as it were Treble-Belly'd: the
                two outmost or side-Bellies, opening into that in the middle. The bottom and Neck whereof, are lined with several Glandulous
                Laces, as that of the <hi rend="italic">Tame Pigeon</hi>. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Crop</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Cropper-Dove</hi>, is almost of the same Figure. But the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gulet</hi> of a wonderful extent; when blown up lightly, above nine inches in the girth. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Echinus</hi> large, and so the Glands therein; for the sight of which, I have represented it inside
                outward. Divided, as usually, from the <hi rend="italic">Gizard</hi> by a <hi rend="italic">Muscular Neck</hi>. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Gizard</hi> rounder than of most other Birds. The <hi rend="italic">Muscules</hi> very thick and high in
                the middle, and flater at the edges. The <hi rend="italic">Deductor</hi> stands at the top of it, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reductor</hi> at the bottom. </p>
            <p>The Greater Gut a foot long, and near [. . . .]/[. . . .]<hi rend="sup">ths</hi> of an inch where widest. The slender Gut
                above &#x00BD; a yard long, and not much above [. . . .]/[. . . .]<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of an inch over where smallest. The

                    >Kniting-Pin</hi>. Placed about an inch above the <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi> near

            <head>Of a Jackdaw. </head>
            <p>The Gulet above &#x00BD; an inch over at the top; &#x00BC; at the bottom; being <hi rend="italic">Conick</hi> all the way, as
                in most Birds. </p>
            <p>The Gizard, above [. . . .]/[. . . .] of an inch over, an inch and &#x00BC; long, and very Tendinous. The Guts a foot and
                &#x00BE; long. The first or Greater, &#x00BE; of a foot; and [. . . .]/[. . . .] of an inch wide. The smaller, Ten inches
                long, and somewhat more than &#x00BD; of an inch over. The <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, two inches long, and above &#x00BD;
                an inch over; shaped like the end of a <hi rend="italic">Plummers sodering Iron</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;ca</hi>,
                not much above &#x00BC; of an inch long, and very small. </p>
            <p>All along the slender Gut, and in part of the <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, the chief <hi rend="italic">Muscular Fibers</hi>
                are most curiously <hi rend="italic">Indented</hi>, as in the <hi rend="italic">Mole</hi>; especialy near the <hi
                    rend="italic">C&#x00E6;ca</hi>. Not ill resembling the Needle-Work called <hi rend="italic">Irish-Stitch</hi>. </p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Transverse</hi> to these <hi rend="italic">Fibers</hi> which make the Indentures, and which are continu'd by
                the length of the Gut, run others of the same colour, round about it; one of them to every Indenture, which it divides into
                two equal parts. </p>
            <p>The same <hi rend="italic">Indented-Work</hi> is seen in most other smaller Birds, as well as here, but not every where after
                the same manner, nor in the same place. In the <hi rend="italic">Twite</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Avicula Anadavadensis</hi>,
                it continues also very far, <hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. four inches above the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;ca</hi>. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Redstart</hi>, above three. And in the <hi rend="italic">Titlark</hi>, as far. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Water-Wagtaile</hi>, not above two and &#x00BD;; and an inch below them. In the <hi rend="italic">Solitary-Sparrow</hi>,
                they are also very pretty below the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;ca</hi>. In the <hi rend="italic">House-Sparrow</hi>, they are
                visible only in the small Gut an inch and [. . . .]/[. . . .] above the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;ca</hi>. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chaffinch</hi>, only in the <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>. </p>
            <p>The Gulet of a <hi rend="italic">Jay</hi>, being contracted in the middle, is divided into two slender <hi rend="italic"
                    >Venters</hi>, as the Guts of some Animals. So also is that of a <hi rend="italic">Japan Peacock</hi>. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">Jay</hi>, hath several <hi rend="italic">Muscular Plates</hi>, or <hi
                    rend="italic">Valvul&#x00E6; Conniventss</hi> placed at the distance of [. . . .]/[. . . .] or [. . . .]/[. . . .] of an

            <p>The Gulet exceedeth not &#x00BD; an inch in width. The <hi rend="italic">Echinus</hi> small, with respect to the other parts.
                The Gizard, mean; near an oval shape: the <hi rend="italic">Reductor</hi> conspicuous. Next to the Gizard stands the slender
                Gut, and the Greater follows; as in the <hi rend="italic">Dunghill-Cock:</hi> contrary to the order kept in most other Birds.
                Where they meet, there is a remarquable Contraction. The Indentures run along the lower half of the Ample Gut; with some <hi
                    rend="italic">Undulations</hi> over-against the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;ca</hi>. </p>

            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi>, at top is dilated into a <hi rend="italic">Crop</hi> an inch and &#x00BC; long, and above
                &#x00BD; an inch over. The <hi rend="italic">Axis</hi> whereof, as in a <hi rend="italic">Pigeon</hi>, is the same with that
                of the lower part of the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi>, and not <hi rend="italic">transverse</hi>, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gallinaceous kind</hi>. Curiously Laced with 16 or 18 Rows of Glands, about half an inch long. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Green-Finch</hi> hath a <hi rend="italic">Crop</hi> of the same shape: but the Glands sprinkled all over it; very small,
                yet distinct. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Echinus</hi> very small; not above &#x00BC; of an inch long, and as broad. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Gizard</hi> above &#x00BD; an inch long, almost &#x00BD; an inch broad; thin edg'd, but high in the
                middle; very strong and Tendinous. And it may here be observ'd, That although the <hi rend="italic">Gallinaceous kind</hi>
                have a very large <hi rend="italic">Gizard:</hi> yet in many other Birds, even of the smallest sort, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gizard</hi>, with respect to its bulk, is altogether as strong: that is to say, the <hi rend="italic">Muscules</hi>, with
                respect to their length and breadth, are as Thick, and their <hi rend="italic">Tendons</hi> answerable; as not only in this
                Bird, but the <hi rend="italic">House-Sparrow, Linnet, Titlark</hi>, and many more. And with respect to the Body, some small
                Birds have also a great <hi rend="italic">Gizard</hi>, as a <hi rend="italic">Chaffinch</hi>, which hath one four times as big
                as that of a <hi rend="italic">Linet</hi>. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Guts</hi> about eight inches long. The Greater, three; and above &#x00BC; over where widest. The smaller,

            <p>T<choice><sic>H</sic><corr>h</corr></choice>e <hi rend="italic">Gulets</hi> of Birds, are bigger or less, according to the
                quantity they swallow. More or less Glandulous, according to the Solidity, or the Dryness of their Meat. And with respect to
                the same, the Figure thereof is more simple; or expanded into a <hi rend="italic">Crop</hi>; by which it is retain'd a longer
                time, before it further descends. And according as less or more Time is requir'd, the <hi rend="italic">Crop</hi> is made so,
                as either to have its <hi rend="italic">Axis</hi>, the same with that of the <hi rend="italic">Gulet</hi>; or else to stand
                Collateral, and so open <hi rend="italic">transversly</hi> into it. </p>
            <p>After the Meat hath been sufficiently macerated there, it descends into the <hi rend="italic">Echinus</hi>, for a second
                preparation. So much the more thorowly made here, because by far greater Glands. And what was done before to all at once, is
                here in, to smaller parcels. This Part in some sort answering to the <hi rend="italic">Crop</hi>, as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reticulum</hi>, in a <hi rend="italic">Sheep</hi>, to the <hi rend="italic">Panch</hi>. Withall it should seem, That when
                the <hi rend="italic">Gizard</hi> is either over loaded, or the Meat not enough prepar'd; 'tis thence returned back to this
                Part, (as the <hi rend="italic">Reticulum</hi> also subserves the <hi rend="italic">Omasus</hi>) till It and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gizard</hi> are more ready, one for the other. For which end also the <hi rend="italic">Muscular Neck</hi>
                below the <hi rend="italic">Echinus</hi>, serves as a Sphincter to purse it up. </p>
            <p>At length it descendeth into the Third <hi rend="italic">Ventricle</hi>. Either Membranous, as in most <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carnivorous Birds</hi>; where the Meat is concocted as in a Man. Or somewhat Tendinous, as in an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Owle</hi>; as if it were made indifferently for Flesh, or other Meat, as he could meet with either. Or most Thick and
                Tendinous, called <hi rend="italic">The Gizard</hi>; wherein the Meat, as in a Mill, is ground to pieces, and thence pressed
                by degrees into the Guts in the form of a <hi rend="italic">Pulp</hi>. For which purpose, the <hi rend="italic">Deductor</hi>
                serves to deliver the Meat from the <hi rend="italic">Echinus</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Laboratory</hi>; as a <hi
                    rend="italic">Hopper</hi> to a <hi rend="italic">Mill</hi>. The four Grinders or chief Operators, as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Millstones:</hi> Partly, as they are extraordinary Thick, and made with double Tendons; whereby they are constring'd with
                the greater force. And partly, as their Tendons stand high in the centre, so as to be <hi rend="italic">arched:</hi> for so,
                every time the Tendons are contracted, they must needs make a shallower Arch, and so force the insides of the Grinders closer
                together. And as the <hi rend="italic">Millstones</hi> are peck'd and cut with small Gutters, least their force should be
                evaded: so the Gristly Lining of the Gizard is all over rough, and gather'd into answerable Furrows. And because the forceable
                motion of the Grinders, must needs work the Meat from under them: as therefore in some <hi rend="italic">Mills</hi> there is
                one attends still to turn the Grist under the Stone; so the <hi rend="italic">R ductor</hi> here, to deliver it back to the
                Grinders, and so over and over, till it be sufficiently elaborated for the Guts. </p>
            <p>And as the strong and continual motion of all these <hi rend="italic">Muscules</hi>, is taught us from their structure, so
                likewise from their red colour, which especially in the Grinders is intense. Hence in a <hi rend="italic">Fish</hi>, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Muscules</hi> which move the <hi rend="italic">Fins</hi> are usually Red, although the rest of the Flesh is
                very white: And so the Leg of a <hi rend="italic">Domestick Fowl</hi>. Whereas the Wings also of a <hi rend="italic">Wild
                    Fowl</hi>, are of the same colour. So likewise the Flesh of a driven <hi rend="italic">Calf</hi>, or of a <hi
                    rend="italic">Hare</hi>, though that of a <hi rend="italic">Coney</hi> be white. And that which comes nearer, the Heart in
                all Creatures, having the like continual motion, is of a Red Colour. </p>
            <p>The Guts are of different length and bigness, not always proportionable to that of the Bird, but the nature of the Meat. So
                those of a <hi rend="italic">Casowary</hi>, though it be necessary, that they should contain Meat enough for so great a Body:
                yet not, that the Meat, which is very nutritive, should make any long voyage. Yet is it needful there should be a <hi
                    rend="italic">Connivent Valve</hi> before the <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, for the guarding of so open a passage. And so
                with Variety in other Birds, according as they feed on <hi rend="italic">Worms, Seeds, Fruits, Flys</hi>, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shell'd Insects</hi>, requiring a longer, or more open passage, for their more deliberate, or safer Transmission to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi>. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Indentures</hi> also seem to be made, and with variety; to the same Intent: <hi rend="italic">sc</hi>.
                That the Guts hereby receiving the greater Contraction and Dilatation, may so much the more forceably detrude the Meat, or
                more easily give way to it; as it is softer, or mixed with Shells, Stones and the like. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;ca</hi>, especially where large, and made for a further Concoction of the Meat; for the better
                Retention hereof, where they open into the <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, are very straight. And for the same reason, also
                thinner and less <hi rend="italic">Muscular</hi> than the other Guts: that so the Meat therein may lie the more quiet. </p>
            <p>The ampliation of the <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, chiefly in <hi rend="italic">Wild Fowls</hi>, amongst other Reasons, is,
                I suppose, That the Dung lying there in good quantity, may be as a <hi rend="italic">Counter-poise</hi> to the Head, to keep
                it up in flying. </p>

      <div>
            <head><hi rend="italic">CHAP. X</hi>. Of the Stomachs and Guts of FISHES.</head>
            <p>IN so many as I have open'd, two Things are more generally observable, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. That many of them have no
                Stomach, that is one that is not Belly'd; as in the <hi rend="italic">Salmon, Jack, Tench, Barble, Breme:</hi> or very little,
                as in the <hi rend="italic">Place</hi>. And many more, instead of One <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum</hi>, as in some <hi
                    rend="italic">Quadrupeds</hi>; or Two, as in most Birds; have three or four, as the <hi rend="italic">Pearch</hi>; nine or
                ten, as the <hi rend="italic">Rochet</hi>; many more, as the <hi rend="italic">Trout</hi>, above thirty; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Whiting</hi>, above forty; the <hi rend="italic">Salmon</hi> many more. </p>
            <p>The Stomach of a <hi rend="italic">Place</hi> shaped almost like the <hi rend="italic">Echinus</hi> of a Bird. Bounded at the
                bottom with a <hi rend="italic">Connivent Valve</hi>. The Guts two only. The upper end of the first, hath two little
                extuberant Parts, the use whereof may be answerable to one use of the <hi rend="italic">C&#x00E6;cum, sc</hi>. To divert the
                Meat, lest upon any Inverted Motion of the Gut, it should regurgitate into the Stomach, or strain the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Valve</hi>. The bottom of this Gut is separated from the <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, by another pretty <hi
                    rend="italic">Connivent Valve:</hi> both which, and the visible Texture of the <hi rend="italic">Fibers</hi>, are shewed
                in the last <hi rend="italic">Table</hi>. </p>
            <p>The Stomach of a <hi rend="italic">Salmon</hi> is only like a wide Gut. He hath about fourscore <hi rend="italic"
                    >C&#x00E6;ca</hi>, hanging on the great Gut, almost like the <hi rend="italic">Mane</hi> upon the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Neck</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">Horse</hi>. Being ty'd altogether with small Vessels, and the Vessels hid with Fat; they
                have been mistaken by some for a <hi rend="italic">Pancreas</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi> is guarded with about
                thirty <hi rend="italic">Annular Valves</hi>. </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Whiting</hi> hath a large Stomach, which is a distinct Bag or Belly. And numerous <hi rend="italic"
                    >C&#x00E6;ca</hi>, not standing as in the <hi rend="italic">Salmon</hi>, but all in a Ruck. The Stomach and Guts of a <hi
                    rend="italic">Cod</hi> are very like. </p>
