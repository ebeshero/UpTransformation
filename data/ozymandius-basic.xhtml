         I met a traveller from an antique land,<br/>
         Who said—Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br/>
         Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br/>
         Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br/>
         And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br/>
         Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br/>
         Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br/>
         The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br/>
         And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br/>
         My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<br/>
         Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br/>
         Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br/>
         Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br/>
         The lone and level sands stretch far away.”
