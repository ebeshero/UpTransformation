      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The official description of the William R. and Erlyn Gould Distinguished Lecture on Technology and the Quality of Life Series states:</p>
      <p>"The William R. and Erlyn J. Gould Distinguished Lecture on Technology and the Quality of Life was inaugurated October 7, 1992, at the University of Utah Marriott Library. In establishing the lecture series, Bill and Erlyn Gould both recognized the critical need for continuing public education about issues regarding modern technology and its impact on our daily lives.</p>
      <p>Inherent to the advantage of technology is the importance of understanding the ramifications and responsibilities that accompany modern scientific discovery. Only through continuing public education can scientific fact and social philosophy be successfully merged.</p>
      <p>The lecture series is intended to provide a forum for the discussion of problems, issues, experiences, and successful case histories of the regeneration and preservation of our communities through the application of modern technology.  It is hoped that an increased awareness of obligation in the public trust will emerge among practitioners of technology as they address the very important environmental and life-deteriorating problems facing society today.</p>
      <p>Through interaction between technologists and opinion leaders in communities that are the benefactors of their efforts, a synergism can develop through which society may see great benefit in the long-term future.  With the lecture series, it is intended that a dialogue be opened between the technologist, the philosopher, the humanist, the private citizen, and all who may wish to assert an active voice in our collective future.</p>
      <p>In such an atmosphere of mutual interest and understanding, no one group will be singled out for exclusion or blame for society's ills; rather, through understanding, discourse, and public education the positive direction of our future may be shaped.  The Marriott Library's mission is to provide information in all formats sufficient to support the scholarship, teaching, and research programs of the University of Utah to its students and faculty, and to the citizens of the state.</p>
      <p>In this light, the annual lecture will strive toward providing a greater public understanding of technology and the social potential that can be cultivated.</p>
      <p>In conjunction with the Utah Science, Engineering, and Medical Archives program of the Marriott Library, the lecture series will provide the means of bridging the many disciplines of technology while meeting the needs of the public in understanding its rich and diverse technological heritage.

          <p>This is the Inaugural lecture in the William R. and Erlyn J. Gould Distinguished Lecture Series. The opening speaker, Greg Thomas, introduces the Gould Lecture Series that will address technology and the quality of life. He mentions that the William R. and Erlyn J. Gould Endowment will support the Marriott Library's Utah Science, Engineering, and Medicine archives as well as general library programs and the lecture series itself. Roger K. Hanson thanks Gould for his support and Arthur K. Smith, President of the University of Utah, addresses the effects of university budget cuts and the importance of private supporters like Gould.  </p>
          <p>William Gould explains the purpose of his lecture series and talks about the case history on technology as it applies to the electric industry where he worked most of his life. He also speaks briefly about his wife who passed away recently, recounting how they met and her support in his endeavors.  After the speech, he responds to questions from the audience.

          <p>Greg Thompson welcomes the audience and introduces the topic of the lecture series, technology and the quality of life. Arthur K. Smith introduces the speaker, Alan Ashton, cofounder of WordPerfect.</p>
          <p>Ashton speaks about the success of WordPerfect, beginning with two ideas for computer research projects that he pitched to his professors as a student. The first one accepted was a computer music program that he developed as a graduate. He screens a demonstration of how it worked. Nine years later he finally began development of his second idea, WordPerfect, with a group of graduate students while teaching at BYU. Ashton describes the process of trial and error they underwent and the competition they faced from other companies. Finally, he explains his purpose for creating WordPerfect, gives examples of how it has been beneficial, and argues against the idea that it generates laziness. The lecture concludes with questions from the audience.

          <p>The speaker of this lecture is John Neerhout, Jr., an executive vice president, director, and senior partner of Bechtel Group, Inc. (BGI). In February 1990, Neerhout served in the United Kingdom as project chief executive for Eurotunnel, owner of the Channel Tunnel. In this lecture, Neerhout talks about the history and challenges of the Channel Tunnel transport project, a tunnel that connects Britain and France. According to Neerhout, it is one of the largest private construction projects on record and was dreamed about for over 250 years starting with Napoleon. Diagrams and photographs are shown on the screen to accompany the speech. A short informative video about the Eurotunnel is shown afterwards. Finally, there is a question and answer session.

This argument that is generally torn between increasing competition in the electric system or providing electricity through vertically integrated utilities. He gives various ways of addressing the challenge and concentrates on three areas: the need for an energy infrastructure, tension between the government Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the states, and potential solutions for constructing the energy infrastructure.  Finally, there is a question and answer period at the end.
