          <p>"All Night Coffee Shop":  A short horror narrative about young woman who confesses to sleeping with window open at night because she has dreamt since a small child that a dark figure would come to her at night and abduct her.  While working as a waitress at an all night coffee shop the young woman notes the appearance of a mysterious man in dark clothing in the empty shop.  Hoping for some company, she tries to strike up a conversation with the man who then grabs her wrist and she falls into a vision of sorts in which she is "shown" the emotional consequences which could follow by choosing a life as a vampire.  The vision cures her of her curiosity, and she confesses to a filmmaker that she doesn't desire such a life any longer but has never forgotten the experience.  Extras for this film include a trailer and a stills gallery with behind the scenes production photographs as well as stills from the film.</p>
          <p>"The Couch":  A silent film with musical accompaniment about two young men who discover an abandoned couch on the side of the road.  After carrying the couch into town, they attempt to transport it via the city's light rail system but can't seem to get it through the doors.  After giving up on the light rail, the men continue to carry the couch when they are accosted by a group of smoking men loitering outside of a bar.  One of the young men carrying the couch gets into a fight with one of the smokers as all others watch the spectacle with little interest.  Finally, one of the smokers intervenes and ends the fight.  All of the men share a cigarette on the couch on the sidewalk outside of the bar and then the smokers assist the young men in carrying it to their apartment.  The film ends with all five men playing video games while sitting on the couch.</p>
