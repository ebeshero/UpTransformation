      <abstract encodinganalog="description">The Hatch River Expeditions video collection (1923-1998) consists of movies documenting the Hatch family and Hatch River Expeditions river trips from the 1930s to the 1990s.  Robert Rafael "Bus" Hatch and his family began guiding groups down the Green and Yampa Rivers in the mid 20th century, and their legacy is continued by the third generation Hatches still running their river running business.</abstract>

      <head>Organizational History</head>
      <p>Robert Rafael "Bus" Hatch and his brothers Alton and Tom began boating in the Vernal, Utah, area in the late 1920s. They ran the Green River in 1931, the Green and Colorado through Cataract Canyon in 1933, and the Grand Canyon in 1934. In 1935-36, they ran the Middle Fork of the Salmon River in Idaho, as well as the Main Salmon. By the end of World War II, Bus Hatch in particular had become known as a river runner. With the controversy over the planned Echo Park Dam in Dinosaur National Monument in the late 1940s and early 1950s, many people turned to Bus Hatch and his sons, Don, Ted, and Frank, to take them down the Green and Yampa Rivers. During the controversy, Hatch River Expeditions outfitted river trips for both pro-dam and anti-dam groups, trips that often included over 100 people. This was the true genesis of Hatch River Expedtions. After the controversy, and through the 1960s, the name Hatch became synonymous with river running, especially in the western United States. By the end of the 20th century, Hatch had become one of the best-known river outfitters in existence, and there are now 3rd generation members of the Hatch family who are still in the river running business.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="description">
      <p>The Hatch River Expeditions video collection (1923-1998) consists of films and videos that document Hatch river trips on the Green, Colorado, San Juan, Middle Fork of the Salmon, Selway, and other rivers, including some scenes of a 1956 river trip on the Indus River in Pakistan.  The collection also contains films that document Hatch family history, including scenes in and around Vernal, Utah that depict family life, work, town scenes, hunting and fishing, skiing, and other family activities.</p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement encodinganalog="description">
      <p>The collection is arranged in two parts: the 1987 donation, and the 2006 addendum.  The 1987 addendum contains five films on two VHS videocassettes, of which one is not a Hatch family or Hatch River Expeditions trip.  The 2006 addendum is arranged as follows:  films; videocassettes, depicting Hatch family, including home movies and family river trips; river trips that were filmed by friends and passengers on Hatch River Expeditions trips, including promotional films and copies of videos made by passengers and later sent to Hatch River Expeditions; and non-Hatch videos, which are either videos obtained by Meg Hatch while she was on the Utah Travel Council Board, or were sent to Hatch River Expeditions or Hatch family members.  All are arranged chronologically within these subdivisions.</p>

          <p>Four films on one VHS videocassette:</p>
          <p>1. "This is Dinosaur"  1951.  start to 26:29</p>
          <p>2. "Wilderness River Trail" 1952.  26:35 to 58:40</p>
          <p>3. "Boondoggle of a basin" 1952.  58:48 to 1:08:00</p>
          <p>4.  "Sculptured Earth" 1964.  1:08:15 to 1:56:16</p>
          <p>First three films are about the Echo Park Dam controversy in the early 1950s.  The US Bureau of Reclamation planned to build a dam on the Green River in Dinosaur National Monument, and the Sierra Club and other conservation organizations mobilized to fight it.  Charles Eggert's films were instrumental in defeating the dam.  "Boondoggle..." is about the Colorado River Storage Project in general, of which the Echo Park Dam was a part.  It is Eggert's only attempt at animation.  "Sculptured..." is a film that lays out the case for the creation of Canyonlands National Park in southern Utah.  A screening of the film was banned from the University of Utah campus in 1964.</p>
          <p>Inserted in box is letter from Charles Eggert to Don Hatch, January 19, 1993, explaining how and why he made these video copies.</p>

          <p>Narration/Script by John H. Chapman, photography/editing by George T. Henry.  Five Seasons Productions, Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  1960s Hatch promotional film; notable for sideburns on crew, pliers on belts, cheesy 1960s music, building fires on the open ground, Mae West-style PFDs, surplus boats.  One scene shows a Park Ranger in a decked canoe running a rapid; Glade Ross?  Also shows Warm Springs Rapid on the Yampa River in its present state, so film must have been made after June 1966 when the rapid was formed.  35:00</p>
