          <p>Frontier Code Blue examines a quiet crisis in health care in the nation's most isolated areas.  In hundreds of rural towns in the Mountain West, health care systems are in danger of collapse.  Critical shortages of trained medical personnel leave many communities without any form of emergency care.  Rural hospitals are closing at the rate of one per month under the strain of expensive technology and the inability to recruit physicians.  Whether they could afford the care or not, nearly one million residents of the rural Mountain West have no access to medical care...simply because it does not exist.  58:00 minutes.</p>

          <p>The impact of human genetics upon life and medicine inside and outside the laboratory is revolutionary.  What geneticists discover in the lab today will profoundly change our lives tomorrow--from decisions about what we eat, to the way we prevent, diagnose and treat human disease, to ultimately, how we frame our philosophical questions about birth and death.  56 minutes.</p>

          <p>The vast landscape of Utah's West Desert has become a crossroads for a national energy, safety and accountability crisis.  Already surrounded by military, chemical, and radiation hazards, the small Skull Valley Band of the Goshute Indian tripe may partner with a consortium of nuclear power utilities to store 80 million pounds of spent uranium fuel rods from the nation's nuclear power plants for up to 40 years.  With federal approval, an above ground storage plan would move forward on the tribe's reservation lands, despite the opposition of Utah's governor, the state legislature, and public sentiment.  Balanced and in-depth, Ken Verdoia's Skull Valley: Radioactive waste and the American West details a full-blown power struggle that pits government against government, culture against culture, and leaves little room for public concern to be addressed.  It's one of the most compelling public policy crises of the new century, and at the center of the controversy is arguably the most lethal industrial waste ever produced by man.  90 minutes.</p>

          <p>It was the best of times. Everyone liked Ike, and they loved Mayor Earl J. Glade. City streets were vibrant and drive-in movies were the place to be.  Women didn't go downtown without their hats and gloves. Movie houses like the Southeast Theater were packed-and not by crowds dressed in jeans and T-shirts, but in coats, ties, dresses and heels.  Ushers escorted droves of ticket-holders to the Technicolor world of Doris Day and Clark Gable.  Host Ted Capener takes viewers on a nostalgic journey featuring archival photographs and personal anecdotges from people who remember the fifties best.  Produced by Elizabeth Searles, Utah in the 50's: Salt Lake City with Ted Capener recalls a decade when cars were snazzy, malt shops ruled, and Elvis was King.</p>

          <p>One hundred years ago, a solitary figure roamed the desert Southwest seeking to capture the endless sky and towering mesas in paint and poetry. His vision of the West was Matchless.  Maynard Dixon survived the great destruction of San Francisco by earthquake and fire, the Great Depression, and the civilizing of the West.  He spent over two decades sketching it for popular books and magazines, and then decades more on a question to find and portray it: the "real" West-the vast space, intense silence, and profound spirit of the land and its people. Discover the man and his art.  56 minutes.</p>

          <p>Its whitewater formed the backdrop for one of the nation's great adventure stories.  Some consider it the birthplace of the modern environmental movement and its waters still attract those who prize outdoor experiences.  Now, it also attracts those who would use the water to sustain development for an energy-dependent nation and those who want to tap the river to quench booming populations in the West.  What does the future hold for the Green River?  57 minutes.</p>

          <p>It is one of the most significant finds in North America in the past 50 years.  Nested in the heart of Central Utah in Range Creek Canyon are the remains of a lost civilization that once thrived in the American Southwest.  For 500 years, the Fremont Indians lived in parts of the Great Basin and Colorado Plateau as hunters, gatherers, and farmers.  They left detailed art and symbols on the stone faces of canyons they inhabited and stored their grain high on cliff walls in well-built granaries that still survive.  Then, 800 years ago, the Fremont seemingly disappeared.  Today, University of Utah archeologists are surveying an entire canyon of more than 2,000 untouched Fremont Indian sites.  This KUED documentary captures a range of issue and challenges that threaten efforts to understand the past.  57 minutes.</p>

          <p>It's a rivalry so powerful that office friendships turn cool, neighbors grow distant, even the faithful in church pews seem to split down the middle.  It's the nose-to-nose, generations-old â and often hilarious â showdown between football fans of the University of Utah and Brigham Young University.  Red Blood, Blue Blood: The Rivalry delivers first-hand stories through candid conversations with legendary coaches such as LaVell Edwards and Ron McBride.  Broadcasters and writers such as Dick Rosetta, Bill Marcroft, and Paul James share side-splitting anecdotes from behind the scenes.  But the greatest voice comes from the stands â from the men, women, and children who don the Red or Blue as a lifetime commitment and the often hilarious lengths they will go to defend their team.  56 minutes.</p>

          <p>John Wesley Powell was the first, in 1869, to document the area that would later become the town of Green River, Utah. Green River was initially inhabited by Anasazi and Fremont Indians; the town later became the site of oil well, as well as the "Utah Launch Complex," a missile launch site of the White Sands Missile Range. Green River has seen booms and busts, as the area, rich in uranium, swelled in size with the uranium rush of the 1950s, which later dwindled as interest in uranium waned, and which has lately become of interest due to the energy crisis. The beautiful backdrop of this small town has a rich history, and is still a site of outdoor exploration. Available on DVD, 28 minutes.</p>
