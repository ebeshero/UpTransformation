      <p>Claudia Sisemore (b. 1937) earned a Bachelor of Science degree in English from Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1959 and a Masters of Fine Arts in filmmaking from the University of Utah in 1976.  She has also studied painting and exhibits abstractionist paintings in oil and acrylic.</p>
      <p>A teacher of English, drama, creative writing, painting and film production, Sisemore spent fifteen years producing educational films for the Utah State Office of Education, but her primary interest is in her independent documentaries about Utah's visual and performing artists.  Sisemore has filmed over twenty artists, including LeConte Stewart, Alvin Gittins, Virginia Tanner, Maurice Abravanel, Anton Rasmussen, V. Douglas Snow, Lee Deffebach, George Dibble, Larry Elsner, Connie Borup, Kathryn Stats, Ed Maryon, Bonnie Phillips, Denis Phillips, Kasiah Hancock, Francis Zimbeaux, Ted Wassmer, Randall Lake and Willam Christensen. She has also documented Utah's rich history of modern dance through productions focusing on Children's Dance Theater, Repertory Dance Theater and Ririe-Woodbury Dance Company.  After retiring from the Utah State Office of Education, Sisemore formed her own production company, Canyon Video.  She lives in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
