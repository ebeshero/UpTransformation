          <p>The 1960 Winter Olympics held in Squaw Valley, California. Having competed in the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo, and for the National Federation of Skiing Team in 1958 in Badgastein Austria, Marvin competes in his last international race before moving on to coaching ski teams. The event that he competed in was downhill racing.  This film begins with footage of the Melville family packing their camper and driving to California on the ninth of February 1960.  The first Olympic event that the family sees is figure skating.  The second event that is shown is the downhill race, which was held on February 14. After the race, the Melville family and a few friends go to the Squaw Valley Lodge for lunch. During lunch, Mrs. Hanna's ski are stolen.  On February 17 the Melville family attends another downhill race featuring a disabled skier named Lowell Thomas. After this, they attend an Olympic Ceremony followed by the ladies downhill, and the men's giant slalom events.  On February 20 there is yet another downhill event which is filmed with greater detail than the first two.  On February 24 the Melville family attends an ice hockey event, a cross-country skiing event, and the eighty-meter jumping event.  The last events that the Melville family attended were speed skating, pairs figure skating, and ladies slalom ski racing.</p>
