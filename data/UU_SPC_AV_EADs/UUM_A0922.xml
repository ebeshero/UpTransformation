          <p>Gibbs recalls hiking in the Uintah Mountains as a child in the 1950s with Boy Scout Troop 186: "Through my high school years I did an awful lot of hiking, mostly, and no serious climbing. By the time I got into college, I got hooked up with the Ute Alpine Club and with the Salt Lake Grotto."  As he got older, Gibbs took up climbing with his close friend, George Lowe.  He recalls climbing adventures with and others such as Karl Dunn, Eric Eliason, Ed Hicketa, and Bego (George) Gerhart.</p>
          <p>Gibbs discusses graduating from the University of Utah with a PhD in mechanical engineering and developing the Gibbs Ascender as well as his adventures caving, sea kayaking, ski touring, working as a river guide, and participating in other outdoor sports. His first ascents include: The Twin Brothers, the first free ascent of the Bong Eater, Mexican Crack, the S-Matrix II, the original start to Gordon's Hangover, Gordon's Hangover, Gordon's Direct, and Frozen Stool.</p>
