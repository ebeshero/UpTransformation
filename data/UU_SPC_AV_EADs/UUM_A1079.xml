            <p>Boy scouts receive papers of some kind; they all stand in a line smiling and happy.  Then they gather around a table and are seated, then stand with their parents seemingly receiving some kind of recognition.  Four are dressed as Indians and dance around a totem pole, and then others are pushing themselves around on a cart.  The rest who are seated seem very excited. A boy is dressed in a Halloween costume, then more in costume are shown.</p>

Next shot is of a pottery wheel, with a man in a suit and a woman talking while another person uses the wheel.

It then flies from further away to his hand, this time it appears to be unchained.  It is chained again in all the rest of the shots, which mostly show it sitting on a piece of wood.</p>
