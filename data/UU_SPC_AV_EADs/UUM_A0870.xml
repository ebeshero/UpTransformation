      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Released in 1965, Super 8mm film featured smaller sprocketholes than standard 8mm film, leaving more room on the 8mm film strip for the exposed image.  The advent of Super 8 provided families and amateur film makers with a higher image quality than standard 8mm without saddling them with the size and cost of 16mm film.  The Wilkinson family began documenting their activities in 1969, four years after the new format became available.</p>
