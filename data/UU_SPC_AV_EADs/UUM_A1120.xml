      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>At the age of 42, Dr. Jenny Mackenzie left her career as a social worker to become a documentary filmmaker.  Mackenzie was inspired to  make a film about her daughter's soccer team after the team's consistent success compelled the coach (also Mackenzie) to move the team into a boys' league.  The resulting film was selected for film festivals across the country and won awards at the Danville International Children's Film Festival (best short film), the Newport International Film Festival (best children's short) and the Utah Arts Festival (best short film).  It has been nominated for a "Billie" award (named after Billie Jean King) for the positive portrayal of women and girls in the media.</p>

          <p>From DVD jacket: "<title render="italic">Kick Like a Girl</title> is the story of what happens when "The Mighty Cheetahs," an undefeated third grade girls soccer team competes in the boys division.  With humor and candor this documentary reveals the reality of the boy-girl issues and what "kick like a girl" really means on and off the playing field.  The film is narrated by 8-year-old Lizzie, a self described soccer girl, who doesn't let juvenile diabetes, elbow blocks ir grass stains interfere with her desire to compete."</p>
          <p>The film was made in Salt Lake City by Jenny Mackenzie, the coach of the team and includes interviews with the girls on the team, their male opponents, parents, and experts on youth sports.  It focuses on how the girls' teamwork and good sportsmanship led to their continued success.</p>
