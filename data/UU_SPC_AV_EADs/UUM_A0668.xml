      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Topaz War Relocation Center (11 September 1945-31 October 1945) was the fifth largest city in Utah during World War II, when it was home to over 9,000 Japanese-Americans and Japanese immigrants, who were relocated from the West Coast of the United States of America as a result of Executive Order 9066.  Relocated from California's Bay Area, Dave M. Tatsuno recorded his experiences in the camp in moving images.  All footage was shot in secret as neither moving image nor still cameras were allowed in any of the Japanese-American internment camps.  In fact, evacuees were required to turn in all cameras to the War Department once the war began. Tatsuno, rather than give up his camera to the authorities, loaned it to a Caucasian friend who lived in Oakland, California for the duration of the war.  After he was sent to Topaz, Tatsuno mentioned to a camp employee that he wished he had a camera to document life in camp.  The worker offered to have Tatsuno's camera sent to himself and agreed to give Tatsuno the camera once it arrived at the camp.  Tatsuno was a young, married man at the time he was sent to Topaz.  He and his wife had a son who was still a toddler and Tatsuno's wife gave birth to their daughter while in camp.</p>
