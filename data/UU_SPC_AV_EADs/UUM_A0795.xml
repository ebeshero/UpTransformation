      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Jenevieve Hubbard was born in Cedar City, Utah, but her family moved to Pilot Station, Alaska when she was three years old and her brother, fellow Utah filmmaker Seth Hubbard, was two years old.  A village of the native Y'Upik people, Pilot Station infused Hubbard's upbringing with what she describes as a "woven experience of the integration of native culture and western ideals."</p>
      <p>From 2002-2005, Hubbard studied at the University of Utah were she was awarded the Grace Durkee Meldrum Scholarship and earned a degree in painting and drawing.  In 2005 Hubbard joined the Artificial Art Institute, an art collective stationed in a 100-year-old hospital, where she met many influential artists.  She married painter John O'Connell in 2006.</p>
      <p>Hubbard's art has been featured in galleries, newspapers and online; her work has been reviewed and discussed in the Salt Lake Tribune, the Awkward Hour (a cult scene underground podcast), 15 Bytes and the City Weekly. It has been exhibited at Kayo Gallery, Maridadi Gallery, Charley Hafen Gallery and the Utah Cultural Celebration Center.  In 2009 she received an Award of Merit at the Celebrating the Diversity of Women Show at the Utah Cultural Celebration Center, which was juried by Apsara C. DiQuinzo, Assistant Curator of Painting &amp; Sculpture at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.</p>
      <p>Hubbard's body of work includes a series of totemic industrial paintings using soil, tea, ink and acrylic paint inspired by "the elemental themes of her childhood, drawing from indigenous mythologies and reflecting her attempts to navigate the spiritual fall-out of a disconnected and isolated modern existence."  Her latest work centers on fingerprint imagery and explores "the more personal side of the fingerprint in the form of touch, influence, the human history of place and the positive creative potential of a life."</p>

          <p>This experimental video uses looping images of a woman in a bathtub under water, a woman walking through a river at sunset, and an image of a pile of burning material. The woman in at least some of the shots appears to be Jenevieve Hubbard, the filmmaker. The audio, like the video, is looped.  14:00.</p>
