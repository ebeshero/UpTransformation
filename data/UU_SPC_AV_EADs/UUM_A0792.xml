          <p>1. "We Arrive Here Improvised," a short experimental piece that opens with bats hanging down and cuts to an image of three people lying on their backs facing the camera. The audio sounds like a very sped-up tape with some music in the background.  0:24.</p>
          <p>2. "Not An Ordinary Classic," an experimental piece that opens with images of the Middle East interspersed with shots of what appears to be the Salt Lake City skyline. The music for the first third of the piece is traditional Middle Eastern. Then the audio changes to a more contemporary, jazz-influenced music over shots of a couple kissing and touching one another. The music changes again and the images become more like the Middle-eastern images shown in the beginning of the piece. Title cards saying "The Beginning" "The Middle" and "Climax" come before each change of imagery.  4:34.</p>
          <p>3. "Collaged Realities," an experimental documentary using traditional Middle-eastern music with images from the Middle East (places, people, text) to explore the filmmaker's ethnic history and culture.  6:08.</p>
          <p>4. "Do rageh (Two Bloods)," a documentary exploring the life of Ali Amishrashti, a native of Salt Lake City, Utah, who was born to an Iranian father and a caucasian American mother. Images of the Marriott Library's Middle East Library as well as images from some its holdings are interspersed with images of Amishranti's home, friends, and family.  12:44.</p>
          <p>5. "Just Passing Through," a short narrative piece about a young man coming over to his girlfriend's apartment. The woman is Middle Eastern and the man is caucasian. The piece takes place entirely within the woman's apartment and has no music.  7:36.</p>
