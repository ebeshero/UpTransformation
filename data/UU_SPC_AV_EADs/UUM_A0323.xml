      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Even before 1900, miners, mail carriers and other travelers were using skis to traverse Utah's mountain snow, and it was not long before skiing in the state arose as a recreational activity and spectator sport.  The Wasatch Mountain Club formed and began leading ski treks in 1912, and, in 1915, the Norwegian Young Folks Society began organizing ski jumping competitions at Ogden's Becker Hill and along the Wasatch Front.  By 1936, the resort town of Brighton featured the state's first rope tow and hosted ski races, and it was only a short time after Joe Quinney formed the Salt Lake City Winter Sports Association in 1937 that Utah's first chairlift (only the second in the country) was constructed at the former alpine mining town of Alta in 1938.  In the 1940s, Norwegian ski jumper Sverre Engen became Alta's first ski patrolman and the Forest Service's first snow ranger, while his equally accomplished older brother, Alf, took over Alta's ski school.  As skiing continued to increase in popularity, organized ski areas sprung up throughout the Wasatch Mountains and in alpine areas across the state, attracting recreational and competitive skiers from local communities and around the world.  Salt Lake City hosted the Winter Olympic Games in 2002.</p>
      <p>The Utah Ski Archives was established in 1989 to preserve a comprehensive history of skiing in Utah and the Intermountain region.  They are housed at the University of Utah J. Willard Marriott Library in the Special Collections department and consist of photographs, manuscripts and audio-visual material.</p>

          <p>2.) <emph render="italic">Ski Flight: A Document of Skiing According to the Principles of Hannes Schneider (with OTTO LANG)</emph> (1937)</p>

The film's featured instructors include Paul Velar (Franconia), Bruce Fen (Lake Placid), Paula Levar (Mittersill), Gary Fisher (Stowe), Rudy Kirsteiner (Snow Ridge), Herbert Schneider (North Conway) and Kurt Sparks (Stowe).  As there was no written guide accompanying the VHS tape, the names of featured ski instructors may be spelled incorrectly.</p>

          <p>Silent, B/W (13 minutes)</p>

The film utilizes the talents of professional ski instructors such as Phil Jones, Glen Young, Barry Bryan, Eric Wendish, Toby Vanue, Paul Velar and Willy Shepler.  The preceding names were taken from the narration accompanying the film and therefore may be spelled incorrectly.</p>
