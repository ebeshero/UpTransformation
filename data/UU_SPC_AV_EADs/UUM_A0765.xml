      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Leo Loving is a Utah filmmaker and the founder of Loving Images - The Good Movie Company.  According to the company website, www.lovingimages.net, Loving Images is "dedicated to the proposition that respect for traditional American values is the best way to further American ideals and to secure peace and freedom for ourselves and future generations . . . Loving Images recognizes that these same values are accepted by men and women of good will the world over and is therefore, committed to presenting, upholding and promoting these values through the medium of film."  Loving and his organization believe in the heroism and martyrdom of John Birch.</p>
      <p>John Birch was originally sent to China as a missionary for the Fundamentalist Baptist Church.  He quickly learned the language and taught the natives his beliefs.  As the threat of Japanese invasion increased during World War II, Birch assisted the local Chinese governments as well as the United States military by aiding the Doolittle Raiders and later assisting to create an intelligence operation in China to help Chinese and US forces monitor the movements of the Japanese.</p>
      <p>Birch later joined earned the rank of Captain in the United States Air Force and continued work in intelligence.  Before the Japanese surrender, Birch was sent on a mission by his commanding officer, but he and his party were taken captive by Chinese Communist forces that later killed and mutilated him and one of his Chinese officers.  Some belive his murder by Communist Chinese officers catalyzed the conflict between the US and Communist China.</p>
