      <head>Organizational History</head>
      <p>Spy Hop Productions is a not-for-profit youth media center specializing in educational solutions through the multimedia arts. Their mission is to cultivate the visions and voices of an emerging generation - via the big screen, the airwaves, and the world-wide-web. Founded in 1999 by Utah natives Rick Wray and Erik Dodd, Spy Hop Productions was created with a vision to empower underserved youth through multimedia arts education and to meet the demands of the community for after-school programming that helps prepare young people for the digital future. With their experience and expertise in education, multimedia production and business management, Mr. Wray and Mr. Dodd successfully developed the organization from a two-person operation to one that now serves over 600 young people a year and employs over 25 full and part-time employees.</p>
      <p>In collaboration with community partners such as the Mayor's Office Youth City Program, the Sundance Institute, the University of Utah Youth Education, the Boys and Girls Club, ArtStart Rowland Hall St. Marks, Art Kids, and the Kennedy Center Imagination Celebration of Salt Lake City, Spy Hop Productions provides a creative and dynamic studio environment where young people of all backgrounds actively engage in the production of their own narratives and solutions to the challenges they face. The young participants involved in Spy Hop's programs have worked with mentors and instructors in multiple media arts disciplines including documentary arts, film and video production, radio, web design, 3D graphics, and animation. In 2004, the young producers' creative works reached local and national audiences exceeding two million people.</p>

            <p>A teenage girl is stuck going on an astrology field trip during the first week of summer when she'd rather be going to see the Ramones in concert.  On the journey one of her fellow classmates, Peter, carries with him a small lunch cooler which contains a mysterious secret he guards.  In the cooler is some form of insect he nurtures but when he leaves the cooler in the care of the girl, Josh (a trouble-making jock) slips a large beetle into it.  Later in the van as they travel to their next stop, Peter opens the cooler to see the beetle.  Josh confesses to having taken the butterfly which was apparently in the cooler and accidentally lets the insect fly out the window to be killed on the windshield of a car.  On the way home, they open the windows in the van and several butterflies fly into the van and they stop the vehicle to witness a butterfly migration and Peter smiles for the first time during the film.</p>

            <p>A girl, Beth, and her boyfriend, Cam, help her new roommate move in and have a celebratory dinner.  Cam walks in on the new roommate, Amy, and her lesbian girlfriend kissing and is disturbed by it and the fact that his girlfriend lives with a lesbian. When he tells a friend about it, the friend councils him to get to know Amy as he might discover she's cool and they have common interests...other than girls.  When he goes over to Beth and Amy's house he meets Gavin, a friend of Amy's, and they talk about Jeeps for a while.  In another room Amy tells Beth she hopes Gavin meets someone nice as the breakup with his last boyfriend was difficult.  Later Amy's girlfriend confronts Cam about how he avoids Amy and is giving her the cold shoulder because she is a lesbian.  After the confrontation, Cam vandalizes Amy's car as Beth spies him in the act from a window.  Cam's hatred escalates until he beats Amy with a tire iron.</p>

            <p>Exploring the history of non-Latter-Day Saint immigrants to the Salt Lake Valley, this film looks at various factors pulling immigrants toward relocation in Utah such as the Trans Continental Railroad, mining, and factors in their homelands which lured populations from Jewish, Greek, Hispanic, and various other communities. Due to the fact that the LDS Church discouraged its members from working in the mines, the mining industry was a strongly diverse opportunity center for immigrants not associated with the LDS culture.  The emigrant population working in the mines created their own community on the west side of town full of "blue collar" workers.  Little now remains of these communities and most of the buildings still standing have been gutted or altered so much that there is little left to show little of the emigrant heritage of those working in the mines, smelting, and factories of that area.</p>

The passerby hostilely refuses and an argument ensues, catalyzing the three homeless boys to attack and rob the man, making off with his wallet and cell phone.  The man who was robbed, then makes his way to the sheriff for help.  Meanwhile, another boy mocks some the homeless people when they ask him for money and he too is attacked and robbed.  Finally, when the second man seeks the sheriff's aid, the slow-acting sheriff begins his search for the thieving homeless.  When the sheriff attack the leader of the homeless, one of the other gives a speech modeled after Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech.  The sheriff then shoots and kills the leader of the homeless gang.  The film ends officially at this point but is trailed by a few semi-related skits, "Bums Dancing" and "Frolicking."</p>

Her sisters wake up and suggest explanations as to why the socks are stuck on her feet.  After attempting to remove their sister's socks, the sisters discover that they are now stuck to their sister's socks.  The logically minded of the two sisters suggests that the "sock sister" go around the house to find out what sticks to her and what doesn't then find out why those items that don't stick...don't. They soon discover that anything the sister loves, sticks to her such as her socks, her sisters, and their dog.  As soon as the revelation is made, the sisters become unstuck.

After a rise in his career, Dan chokes on a piece of steak on night and finds himself in Hell (filmed in the Utah salt flats).

In order to win, Dan has to make the devil laugh.  After a long and painful attempt to make Satan laugh Dan finds inspiration and is able to make the devil laugh by telling jokes about God and religion.  When he awakes to a knock at his door, Dan is served by "Jesus H. Christ" with a restraining order to bar him from Heaven for eternity for the things he said while in Hell.</p>

A couch potato family, the Bunnies, frantically takes up a quest for their remote control when they discover it is missing.

After stealing what they thought was a free car, the Bunnies head to a movie theatre where they are thrown out again for disturbing other audience members.  Buster, the young son, remembers that he's had the remote with him the entire time.  When Buster pulls the remote from his pajamas, it slips from his hands and is run over by a car.  Returning home Buster is punished by becoming the human remote control anytime his family wants to change the channel.</p>

              <item>Dream Come True? - Documentary.  Teens attending Highland High School's magnet program for English as a Second Language (ESL), discuss their experiences as students at Highland High School, give their own definitions of the word "refugee," and what the word means to them.  The refugee students (particularly those from Somalia) then ask students and teachers what they believe refugees are and what they think about the number of refugee students at Highland High School.  Refugee students also discuss peer pressure, acceptance from local students, and the friends and family they left behind when they came to the United States.  The refugee students are then followed home to show their homes and to describe their culture, religion, and how those things have been affected since they came to America (see item 7).</item>
