      <p>Edwin Brown Firmage (b.1935) teaches constitutional law and international law at the University of Utah S.J. Quinney College of Law in Salt Lake City, Utah. A Hinckley Fellow at Brigham Young University (BYU), he graduated with high honors in political science and history before earning his Master of Arts. He was National Honors Scholar at the University of Chicago Law School and served on the editorial board of the Chicago Law Review. He received the doctor of law, master of laws, and doctor of jurisprudence degrees from Chicago.</p>

      <p>He served as Fellow in Law and Humanities at the Harvard Law School in 1974-75. He received the University of Utah Distinguished Teaching Award in 1977 and the Brigham Young University Alumni Distinguished Achievement Award in 1978.</p>
      <p>The University of Utah invited Dr. Firmage to deliver the annual Reynolds Lecture, <emph render="italic">Ends and Means in Conflict</emph>, in October 1987.  In 1988, Professor Firmage was awarded the Charles Redd Prize by the Utah Academy of Science, Arts and Letters, for outstanding contributions in the humanities and social sciences during the past five years.

With the late Francis Wormuth, he wrote <emph render="italic">To Chain the Dog of War: The War Power of Congress in History and Law</emph>, second edition published in 1989 by University of Illinois Press.</p>
      <p>Professor Firmage's book with Collin Mangrum, <emph render="italic">Zion in the Courts: A Legal History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</emph>, the first legal history of the Mormon experience in the nineteenth century, was awarded the 1989 first place prize of the Alpha Sigma Nu Book Awards for the best book of the year, given by the Honors Society of the National Association of Jesuit Colleges &amp; Universities in the United States.</p>

Professor Firmage teaches constitutional law at the University of Utah.</p>
      <p>Hugh B. Brown (1883-1975) was one of the most popular twentieth-century Mormon leaders, as well as an attorney, educator, and author. Born on October 24 1883 to Homer Manley and Lydia Jane Brown in Granger Utah, he was fifteen when his family moved to Alberta, Canada.</p>
      <p>Brown went to England as a missionary, serving from 1904 to 1906.  Upon returning from his missionary experiences, Brown married Zina Young Card in 1908.  The couple settled in Alberta, Canada where the first six of their eight children were born.  In 1912  Brown undertook military training preliminary to organizing a Latter-day Saint contingent for the Canadian armed reserves. By 1917 Brown had achieved the rank of major in the Canadian military. The Imperial military significantly influenced Brown, as shown in accounts of his service in his later writing, but he ultimately turned away from a military career.  Upon returning from World War I, Brown's Canadian vocations included stints as cowboy, farmer, soldier, businessman, and head of the LDS Lethbridge Stake.</p>
      <p>Brown had studied at the Law Society of Alberta prior to his military service. Renewing an interest in law, he began working with Z. W. Jacobs, a Cardston barrister.  Completing a five-year apprenticeship while working a farm he had purchased near Cardston, Brown passed the bar examination and was admitted to the bar in 1921. Moving to Salt Lake City in 1927, Brown quickly became a successful lawyer and president of the LDS Granite Stake. He also formed a lifelong allegiance with the Democratic party, which led to an unsuccessful run for political office and an unpleasant term of service as first chairman of Utah's Liquor Control Commission from 1935 to 1937.</p>
      <p>A call to head the LDS British Mission came soon, the first of many full-time church positions which brought him admiration and influence, but never the affluence for which he also yearned. As LDS Servicemen's Coordinator from 1941 to 1945, he traveled extensively in North America and western Europe as de facto chief chaplain for the thousands of Mormons in American, British, and Commonwealth uniforms; anecdotes born of this experience punctuated his sermons and writings thereafter. Early in 1944 he was given an additional appointment to reactivate the British Mission.</p>
      <p>Intervals as a professor of religion at Brigham Young University (1946-1949), and with an Alberta oil prospecting firm (1949-1953), preceded his call, at age seventy, to be one of the LDS General Authorities - an Assistant to the Council of the Twelve. Thereafter he became a member of the Council of the Twelve in 1958, and Counselor to and then Second Counselor in the First Presidency in 1961, becoming First Counselor in 1963. His record of earlier service, his effective writings and sermons, and his long friendship and ideological affinity with LDS Church President David O. McKay probably accounted for his rapid advancement in the church hierarchy. McKay's failing health and his own policy differences within the church leadership later weakened Brown's influence, though his popularity remained great. Following McKay's death in 1970, he served in the Council of the Twelve until his own death, two years after Zina's, on 2 December 1975.</p>
