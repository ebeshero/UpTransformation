          <p>1.	"The Groder," a brief mockumentary about the Groder, a strange, gimp-like person with an obsession with an ATM. The piece contains no diegetic sound and is accompanied by rambling narration about the Groder.  3:00.</p>
          <p>2.	"Noisy Blood," a short police drama shot around Salt Lake City. The piece features ongoing narration of the hardboiled detective story genre.  The story is about two police detectives on the hunt for a missing person.  7:00.</p>
          <p>3.	"Slapdown," a documentary about the band Slapdown filmed at Liquid Joe's in Salt Lake City. The piece has narration mixed with actual audio from Slapdown's performance. There are also interviews with band members interspersed within the shots of the band performing. The band discusses their genesis as well as how they work together to produce songs.  8:00.</p>
          <p>4.	"THUNDERandLIGHTNINGand," a police drama shot entirely on the University of Utah campus. The piece takes place around a crime scene. The lead character is a volatile police investigator who can discern details about a murder in a fashion flabbergasting to his colleagues. This film uses looped music and innovative editing to achieve a hypnotic, ethereal feeling to the story.  12:00.</p>
          <p>5.	"with Ed," a documentary about a trip Tinney took with a man named Ed to Spanish Fork, Utah. The piece uses no narration and employs only occasional title cards to explain the action.
