          <p>Leigh (1929-1991) was a historian, researcher, guidebook author, and talented photographer. He was an accomplished mountaineer and climber, spending a tremendous amount of time in the Tetons and the Andes. In this interview, Leigh directly correlates the decrease of traditional mountaineering to the raise of competitive climbing. They discuss climbing ethics of old and how they have changed with the development of the sport.</p>
          <p>Leigh discusses his publications regarding the history of the Teton mountain range, particularly his book <emph render="italic">A Climbers Guide To The Teton Range</emph> coauthored by Reynold G. Jackson. He talks about the types and levels of climbing the range offers, as well as his personal experiences climbing in this area.</p>

          <p>Petzoldt discusses everything that he and Brown had in common, activities that they participated in, and their friendship. Fred Brown, Paul Petzoldt and Eldon (Curly) Petzoldt were the first to descent Rendezvous Mountain which is now the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort. This was the first winter ascent of the Grand Teton. They skied to the caves in Garnet Canyon and carried loads of gear up to the lower saddle. From there they ascended to the summit via the Owen Spalding route. Fred later became the president of the ski club and helped form the Jackson Hole Ski Association.</p>
