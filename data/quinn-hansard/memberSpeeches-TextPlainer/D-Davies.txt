I’d like to welcome to the House today Tamara Kronis. She’s a practising human rights lawyer who was formerly with the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal. She now lives in Nanaimo with her family and rescue dog, Austin.

She is joined here by a number of other folks to participate in the Enough Is Enough.

Would the House please make Tamara feel welcome.
