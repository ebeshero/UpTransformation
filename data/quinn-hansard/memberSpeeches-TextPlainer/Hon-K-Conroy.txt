With me today, I have Steve Hawkshaw, the executive director; Andrew Avis, another executive director; Adria Fradley, another executive director; and Ali Chow, a strategic adviser.
================================


Regulations will be finalized by the end of this year, and the OBPS will come into effect on April 1, 2024.
================================


The CleanBC program for industry is well positioned to transition to OBPS. We have systems in place. The ministry also has the organizational capacity to ensure that we meet the deadlines.
================================


Environment is engaging actively with industry, with industry associations, with industrial operators to ensure there is a smooth transition from the existing two OBPS. That does include the B.C. Business Council.
================================


It’s fair to say it would be considered on a case-by-case basis. It will depend on the nature and the stage of consultation. If we’re doing just information gathering then probably don’t need an NDA…. As the consultation goes further along on draft regulations, for instance, those are typically done under NDA.

Particularly, we have to be concerned that we’re not sharing information that could actually be used as insider information, because it’s a tax bill. We want to make sure that if we are having those discussions, that they are under NDA if it’s required.
================================


The information will be public for comment, and it gives opportunity for comments before regulations are finalized. We expect NGOs and others will come forward and provide comments.

The ministry also engages with the Climate Solutions Council, which has representatives from NGOs, from industry, from academia, from youth, from labour. So it’s a broad group of advisers that provide input as well.
================================


The point of the OBPS is to put a price on pollution. If industry meets and continues to meet the standards, then the OBPS has met its objectives, because the goal is to lower emissions.
================================


I have with me David Sinton, a strategic adviser.

Yes, the provincial government shares information with the federal government. It’s an ongoing thing that we have an agreement on. It’s actually not new to this bill.
================================


No.
================================


I’ve got some new staff: Matt Krzepkowski, Brad Snell and Jeffrey Krasnick, all directors of income tax.

Households are combined, just so that the member knows. The credit begins up to $60,000 of the combined household. You get the full credit between $60,000 to $80,000. Then the credit begins to phase out.
================================


Yeah, the member is right. If he and his fictitious girlfriend just live together, not as common-law, they would both qualify if they were under that $60,000 marker. If three students live together, they would each qualify. As long as their income is under the $60,000, they would qualify for the full amount — if they were just living as friends, not as cohabiting.
================================


Yes. However, households are families, and there are economies of scale when you are in a family as opposed to single.
================================


This is meant to support renters.
================================


If they own a manufactured home, they may qualify for the homeowner’s grant. So they would be covered by that. If they don’t own it, they would then qualify for the renters grant, because they would be renting. The staff did think of that when they brought this portion of the bill in.

With that, I move that the committee rise, report progress and ask leave to sit again.
