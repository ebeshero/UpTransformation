Last month I attended a book launch for a book called Mina’s Lunch. It’s a story about a little girl from a different culture who brings an unfamiliar food to lunch at school.

This book came to fruition with the help of a multiculturalism grant from the province of British Columbia, and it supported the great work of the Asian Impact Society, a group of volunteers that formed during COVID to work to eliminate Asian discrimination and to create a space for healing and building inclusive communities through stories and art.

This book was one of their first projects. They wanted to help school children learn about embracing diversity and encouraging acceptance and respect of all cultures. They hope to get copies of the book to all elementary schools in B.C. and are working towards another book next year. In the meantime, they’re taking on other projects.

They’re seeking artist submissions for an art exhibition called Your Art Your Reflections: Multiculturalism, Diversity and Anti-Racism. The goal of the exhibition is to educate the public on why multiculturalism and diversity are important and why there’s no place in our community for racism.

You can submit your art. It’s open to three age categories: 12 and under, 13 to 18 and 19-plus. The submission deadline is June 1, and the exhibition will take place in Place des Arts in Coquitlam. There are many more great projects on the way.

If you’d like to submit your artwork, you can go to asianimpactsociety.com, read more about the great work they’re doing and also follow them on Facebook.
