Take Our Kids to Work Day is a great opportunity for students to get some experience seeing what a work environment is like, and it’s also a great chance for parents and intergenerational connections. Joining us in the House today are several grade 9 students and their parents and caregivers who happen to work for the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. They’re here for Take Our Kids to Work Day.

Joining us are Caleb Jonker, Jennifer Jonker, Erin McIntosh, Meara McIntosh, Eloise Burns, Sharilynn Wardrop, Faye Quin, Melissa Quin, Jillian Burton, Robert Tones, Islay Mei Gordon and Alicen Chow.

I hope members here will join me in making them all feel very welcome today.
