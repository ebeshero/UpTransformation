I want to just note for the record that the member had questions about a contract with RKL Health Informatics, which we responded to in writing. If there are more questions, of course, we would be happy to take those on.

I want to also let the House know that amongst the officials who are with us today are Leanne Heppell, the chief ambulance officer of B.C., and Neil Lilley, the chief operating officer of B.C. emergency health services.

I think the issue on Vancouver Island…. I will endeavour — on the broader issue of eating disorders, I don’t want to take a lot of time. This was an issue that I raised frequently as an opposition critic for Health, and it has been raised back along a number of years, about the adequacy of overall services, but I won’t give a long discussion of that everywhere.

There’s an issue on Vancouver Island with respect to adult and children’s mental health services. One is provided through the health authority, and the other is provided through MCFD. Those two services — it’s my expectation that they’ll be aligned. There have been new resources going through the health authorities for adult mental health services, and it’s my intention, my belief, that those will be aligned.

I’ll provide more information not weeks from now but later today, to the member, to be clear about where we are in that process.
================================


I’m not sure I agree with all the premises of the question. The member will know that, especially in his constituency, we’ve made significant investments in the ambulance service. We talked at length about Revelstoke and Golden. Revelstoke, 24-7; Golden, 24-7; Invermere, 24-7; and Kimberley, 24-7. This is a change and an increase in services that the member advocated for, that we’ve talked about on a number of occasions and that have occurred. This really reflects the transformation of the ambulance service both in the region and in the province, in rural, remote communities.

In addition, with the rural and remote framework, we added an ambulance to the region, to provide additional supports. Obviously, there are other communities. Field — I was talking to an ambulance paramedic from Field last night, actually, at length on this question. But I won’t take up too much of the time to talk about ambulance service in Field. It’s an SOC, and we’re working through, now, the collective agreement, the increase in service in communities such as that.

We see an increase in ambulance services and ambulance response. We obviously monitor it through the years. The circumstances the member is talking about are not new to this year. It is something that we will obviously continue to monitor.

He’s quite right that B.C…. There’s always a discussion about B.C. and Alberta, that we care for a lot more Alberta patients in B.C. than they care for B.C. patients in Alberta. That’s because of policy changes they’ve made in the last number of years because of the challenges facing their health care system. We’re ahead of them in most measures of surgery and other things, and that means we provide more care to Albertans than they provide to British Columbians. We’re not going to respond in kind by limiting that care. We’re going to provide great care when it comes.

I’ve heard the hon. member’s representation. He knows that we’re very responsive when we hear from things in community, and we’ll clearly be monitoring that this summer.

I’d also note that these increases in services, this increase in permanent staff in the region is going to transform the Ambulance Service and, we believe, will result in better service. I think the result of the most recent collective agreement with CUPE Local 873, the ambulance paramedics….

It was supported by 96 percent of ambulance paramedics, which has to be a remarkable thing. I know some ambulance paramedics, and sometimes we don’t have an easy time agreeing on the dinner menu, so 96 percent demonstrates the success of the union and our management at working together to resolve these very issues.

These issues, the issues of communities like Revelstoke, like Golden, like Kimberley, were clearly issues at the table that we worked through. We’re going to continue to do so, and I appreciate the member’s representation.
================================


When people call 911, of course, there are two processes. There’s an E-Comm process, and then, if it’s for ambulance, they’ll ask you what you need, and it’ll go to the ambulance process. Both require…. As the member will know, there has been significant investment by the government, in support of E-Comm in B.C., in the last while. There are some issues there that are being resolved.

There are also issues for BCEHS, I would say, just to look at the dispatcher side that we’ve moved from in the last short period, in the last year. This is higher, since we last were in estimates, from 248 dispatchers to 281. This is a critical issue, this issue of dispatch, to be able to respond to people appropriately when they come and then dispatch.

Obviously, every call that comes into the Ambulance Service is triaged for the severity of need and the severity of response. That goes without saying. I understand, and certainly, will review the issue. I think the issue was in the newspaper, or a complaint was made around this case, which I think involved someone from Langley. I may be mistaken. Every time that happens, we obviously review that to ensure that that doesn’t happen.

There is occasionally a delay, because — even when you have substantially increased the number of dispatchers — if, at some point, a lot of phone calls come in, there may be some issues. So some advice may go out to say, “This is what’s happening” or “Call us back,” and so on, and you go into a priority queue.

In any event, what we believe, anyway, is that substantial investment was required in dispatch in the province. That’s why we’ve provided that significant increase over time. Really, in the last few years, the total is from 235 to 281, which is a substantial net increase in dispatch.

Obviously, those dispatchers — and the member, I know, agrees with this — do an exceptional job responding to people in a moment where, I agree, they’re calling 911, and they need to hear a professional response on the phone. Our ambulance dispatchers do an excellent job. We feel we need more of them, and that’s why more of them have been hired.
================================


A few points. First of all, with respect to mental health supports but also with respect to ambulance paramedics. Just for the record, I agree with the member — and the overdose public health emergency is part of it — that we’re also seeing, and we have seen, a very large increase in what we call purple and red calls, the most serious calls that ambulance paramedics receive, the ones they have to get to right now.

We’ve seen an increase across a range of conditions, including mental health and addictions. That’s one of the significant ones but also conditions such as heart attack and stroke.

Just to say that the number of full-time paramedics has increased from 1,375 to 2,368 since I’ve been Minister of Health. That’s a 72 percent increase in full-time paramedics. The number of part-time paramedics has increased by 87 percent. What we’re seeing — and that’s significant, I think — is a major investment in, and a transformation of, the service.

I wanted to note as well that we’ve added…. Some of this has been through the recent collective agreement, ratified by ambulance paramedics, which very much focused on these issues. The union wanted to, as well. There have been substantial investments to the critical incident stress management program with $5 million provided to that. A joint committee was created in April ’22 to work through these issues. We’ve seen an increase in supports and clinician referrals, of 69 percent since 2021, which demonstrates both the demand, as the member notes, and the needs.

We’re doing an evaluation of that program, which we’re expecting shortly. We’ve added a director of mental health for the system, to support our ambulance teams. We’ve added additional team members to the critical incident stress management program. All of those issues — and the work that we’ve done, together with our union — have made a significant effect.

I’ll just say that in 2022, December ’22, it took approximately one to two weeks for a referral to a clinician to be complete in the service. As of March 31 of this year, the average wait time for a referral request to be accepted by clinician is approximately one to three days. So we went, in this period, demonstrating the priority and the impact of that, from one to two weeks for a referral to one to three days. This all reflects the strong commitment of our leadership at BCEHS.

I, again, want to introduce Leanne Heppell and Neil Lilley who represent the leadership and really represent our extraordinary paramedics around the province.

But the commitment, especially, of CUPE Local 873 to support their members as well…. You see the real tangible improvements that have been made in terms of those supports needed. Because the work, as the member rightly says, in the time of two public health emergencies has been exceptional. The increase in the calls…. That means the response of ambulance paramedics has increased commensurate with the massive increase in resources.
================================


I’ll just go through some of the information for the hon. member. I want to make the point that this has been an exceptional period of growth for ambulance paramedics.

There are two issues, I would argue. One is to ensure, obviously, for the public, that they received that response that we all know. Two, that we support ambulance paramedics. The major issue has not been recruitment, although there’s always a challenge in recruitment. But you can see what we’ve done.

We’ve added, in 2021, 539 permanent regular full-time paramedic positions and 71 irregular full-time positions. In November ’22, we added 222 permanent new full-time positions. If you look at the actual hours worked, the productive hours increased by 10 percent over time. This is an important question — increased by 41 percent the number of hours prepared by ambulance paramedics. The actual hours — that’s not all this discussion of positions and everything else — worked by dispatchers increased by 13.7 percent, and overtime increase by 15.9 percent.

So we have a dramatic effort being made to increase the service. You see the success of that recruitment, and we’re taking extraordinary steps to continue that.

I think the one thing that I would say, and I was just looking at the number here, is the one area where we…. Why it links to the previous question is what we have seen, as well, is a significant increase in ambulance paramedics off work in the last number of years. It’s what drives the commitment to support mental health services in that respect.

When someone is off work, obviously that both puts pressure on overtime but also takes away some of the impact of the very significant increases in the numbers of ambulance paramedics.

I’ll just give the member a sense of this for the last three years. We have, on leave full-time, 219 paramedics on leave in 2021, 270 on leave in 2022 and 292 on leave in 2023. So the issue that we have in the ambulance service and why we are so committed with the union to work on supports that allow people to deal with critical incidents and also come back to work is because it has a real impact on the health human resources in the ambulance service as well.

So you see the ambition — the increases at the Justice Institute, the increases in our partnerships with other paramedic training institutes in the province. All of that is having success, but we have to continue to add, especially on the mental health side, to increase significantly and continue to have strong supports so ambulance paramedics who are full-time but off work get back to work.
================================


I’m going to say a few words, I think brief. Is that brief or brie?

Thank you to the member for the question. I’ll just make a number of points. During the COVID-19 pandemic, which surely was the busy season…. In fact, I think the experience of ambulance paramedics is that the busy season is pretty much 365 days a year, without exception, and since I get information on ambulance calls every day, I can attest to the fact that it’s busy.

I’ll just make a couple of points. In rural response times, rural median response times have gone down by 48 seconds for purple calls since 2018, which is, I would say, a real achievement of the ambulance service, and that’s been a priority of ours. We put in, on April 20, 2021, a rural and remote framework to improve services because we knew we had to get to people, particularly in times of COVID-19. Or should I say 2020, the times of COVID-19, to get people to the hospital more quickly.

We’ve added significantly to cars on the ground. We’ve added significantly to airplanes. We’re about to significantly improve helicopter service, air ambulance helicopter service in the province. We’ve added 125 ground ambulances. We’ll be happy to provide more information on that. So more ambulance paramedics, more dispatchers, more cars, more airplanes, more helicopters.

In some areas, especially on the most severe calls, we’ve done exceptionally well. I would note that the number of the most severe calls, which I referred to earlier, is increasing. The number of those purple calls that I referred to, the number of them that we face across the province in every year, has increased in five years, in a time of population growth of approximately 6 percent, by about 26 percent.

That indicates that when you’re talking about reducing response times on purple calls in the context of the number of calls going up by 26 percent, that is heroic work by ambulance paramedics.

I want to thank, on behalf of the people of the province, the chair of the board, Jim Chu; Leanne Heppell; who became our chief ambulance officer immediately after the period of the heat dome; Neil Lilley; and the whole team, every ambulance paramedic, every dispatcher in the province. I know that all members of the House, regardless of what side of the House they’re on, agree and appreciate…. Our gratitude to them for all their work in this exceptional time.

And with that, I move that the House rise and report progress and ask leave to sit again.
