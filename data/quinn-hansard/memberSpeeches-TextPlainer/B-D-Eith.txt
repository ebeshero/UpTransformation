I seek leave to make an introduction.
================================


On behalf of the MLA for Courtenay-Comox, who’s in the Chair and can’t make this introduction, I’d like to welcome Steph Oostenbrink and Pauline MacDougall, from the grade 6 class of Phil and Jennie Gaglardi Academy in Comox.

Welcome.

Please make them feel welcome.
