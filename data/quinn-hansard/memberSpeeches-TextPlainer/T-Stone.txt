Well, all the words, all the rhetoric, all the bluster in the world from the Public Safety Minister doesn’t take away the fact that we have terrible results by every single measure in British Columbia.

Let’s just take it back to results. We have more overdose deaths than ever before in the province’s history. We have more people on the streets, homeless, than ever before in the province’s history. We have more violent, random attacks taking place in communities right across this province than ever before. We have 40 percent fewer people in jail today under this government than when they came to office. We have more vandalism and crime and social disorder taking place all over British Columbia.

The reality is there is a huge disconnect between what…
================================


…the minister and the government says is happening and what is actually being experienced by British Columbians.

People have had enough. They’ve had enough with the soft-on-crime Premier’s catch-and-release policies. They’ve had enough of the Premier’s deliberate policy to warehouse people without supports. British Columbians have had enough of the Premier careening British Columbia down the path of decriminalization without the guardrails that were promised. British Columbians have had enough.

Just yesterday Victoria residents at the local Quadra Heights playground were accosted by two people who proceeded to dig out a crossbow that they had stashed under the merry-go-round at the playground. “We thought that they were looking for lost drugs, but no, they pulled out a crossbow. I couldn’t believe it. I’m still shaken up by it. I went to work and I still couldn’t calm down, so I came home.” This happened at a children’s playground. Parents and families expect this government to do way better than what is the current reality.

My question to the Premier is this. How many more British Columbians need to be put at risk of violence, literally endangered in their neighbourhoods, in parks, in playgrounds and stores and transit buses? How many more have to face that reality before this soft-on-crime Premier puts an end to his failed policies, does his job and gets serious about prioritizing the safety of British Columbians?
