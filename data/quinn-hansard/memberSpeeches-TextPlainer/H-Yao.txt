I seek leave to make a quick introduction.
================================


I would like to take a moment to welcome St. Francis of Assisi School and the grades 5 and 6 students.

On behalf of the Attorney General, I also want to welcome Abby Murray.

Thank you so much for joining us today in the chamber, observing us from the gallery. Welcome, everyone.
