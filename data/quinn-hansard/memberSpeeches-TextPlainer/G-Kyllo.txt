We’re joined in the House today by a good friend of mine, Jon Coleman, from the Cowichan Valley. Now, Jon is a highly regarded Indigenous business and community leader. Sadly Jon continues to be sidelined from working in his own traditional territory on the Cowichan hospital.

Jon is here today to participate in the Enough Is Enough rally. John is a father. He’s a grandfather. He has significant concerns about the increasing housing affordability and opioid crisis that is disproportionately negatively impacting Indigenous peoples.

Would the House please make my friend Jon Coleman very welcome today.

On April 28, we recognize the National Day of Mourning, a solemn day to honour and remember those who have lost their lives or been injured in the workplace. On behalf of the official opposition, I stand before you to express my deepest condolences to the families and friends of those workers who have lost their lives while trying to earn a living for their loved ones.

The tragic crane collapse in downtown Kelowna less than two years ago claimed the lives of five workers. This heartbreaking incident is not an isolated case, as 181 people in British Columbia lost their lives due to work-related injuries and illnesses last year.

On this day of mourning, reflection and remembrance, we renew our commitment to creating safer and healthier workplaces for everyone. As we remember those we have lost, we must recognize the importance of providing workers with adequate protection and access to necessary resources when they are hurt or become ill.

Government must take a proactive approach to ensure employers provide workers with a safe and supportive workplace. This includes providing the necessary resources and tools to promote the well-being of all employees, employers and stakeholders.

Since 1991, British Columbia has joined the rest of Canada in recognizing the National Day of Mourning by observing moments of silence, wearing ribbons, lighting candles and finding other ways to remember those that we have lost. Today I encourage all of us to find our own way of remembering those we’ve lost and standing with the loved ones and survivors.

Tomorrow let us take a moment to reflect on those we have lost and let us honour their memory by recommitting ourselves to building a safer and more supportive workplace for all British Columbians.

Every worker in B.C. deserves to return home safely at the end of each and every workday.
