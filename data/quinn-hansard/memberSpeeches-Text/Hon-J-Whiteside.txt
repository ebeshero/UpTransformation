================================
I thank the member for the question. When it comes to the role of the Mental Health Act in our province, we know there have been a number of recommendations that have come forward to ensure that the operation of the Mental Health Act works in a better way for people who are involuntarily committed under the act as well as those clinicians who are also working under the Mental Health Act.

We have brought in a rights advice process, as was recommended, in order to ensure that individuals who are receiving that care have appropriate rights advice.

================================
We are working, following the recommendations of the Ombudsperson’s report in 2019, to develop, in collaboration with Health Justice, education and curriculum for clinicians working on the front lines to better improve their ability to work under the framework of that act.

That is work that we’re doing. We’ll continue to work with front-line clinicians to ensure that that act is operating correctly.

================================
Again, I’m grateful for the member’s question and for the advocacy and for all of the work that has been done by the select standing committee, by experts, by all of the clinicians and advocates out in community and in our health authorities who provide input, who provide recommendations, around work that we know is necessary to do in terms of improving how people who are experiencing mental health distress, who are struggling with addictions, are receiving care in our health care system.

We are doing the work to make improvements across the system. We have brought in the rights adviser. We are working with Health Justice on providing better support for clinicians. We know there is much more work to do, and we are doing that work.
