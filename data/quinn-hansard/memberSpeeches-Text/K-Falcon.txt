================================
Today in British Columbia, the public is forced to confront daily incidents of shootings, vandalism, brutal random assaults and rampant lawlessness. The responsibility for this explosion of violence and social disorder falls squarely on the shoulders of this soft-on-crime Premier.

This crisis began during his five years as Attorney General, marked by his catch-and-release program that allows violent prolific offenders to act with total impunity, knowing they’ll be released right back into the community.

His decisions as Housing Minister to warehouse those with severe mental health and addiction issues, without any proper supports, into communities over local community opposition and his utter failure to address encampments and violence in tent cities have only made the crisis worse. Now he’s adding more fuel to the crisis with his reckless decriminalization and disregard for police chiefs’ concerns with the open, public use of crystal meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl.

Andrea Miller, a young mother whose five-year-old daughter, Everleigh, found a bag of fentanyl on her elementary school playground and unwittingly brought it home and thousands of other parents in communities right across this province are saying enough is enough.

My question to the Premier: when will he realize that it’s his record, his policy choices, that are causing the crime, chaos and open drug use that have parents like Andrea and those outside this Legislature fearing for the lives of their children?

With all due respect to the Solicitor General, you know, we hear these words. Oh, they take this so seriously.

You’ve been in power for six years. I just want to remind the opposition: this is your second term in government.

================================
You’ve been there for six years. It sure would be nice to see some actual results instead of rhetoric. The fact of the matter is that our streets, our cafés, buses and even schools have become as unsafe as they have ever been.

Little Everleigh, from Nanaimo, innocently believing that the bag of fentanyl, which she’d found in her elementary school playground, looked cute, carried it home in her backpack to show her younger brother Remington.

Under the family’s kitchen table, her mother, Andrea, discovered her two young children attempting to open this deadly bag of fentanyl. Andrea says: “My child and her two-year-old brother she was playing with would have died had they ingested the substance. A few days later, a significant amount of drug-related items — pipes, uncapped syringes, drug bags, used tinfoil, tie-offs, etc. — were found in the hedges where our children line up for class and play during recess.”

Something is terribly wrong when our children can’t go out to play at recess without putting their lives at risk. The public is saying enough is enough.

My question is this. When are Andrea and the folks in this gallery who are demanding to know, from this Premier…? How many lives must be put at risk before this Premier stands up, does his job and puts the safety of the community before his own radical agenda?
