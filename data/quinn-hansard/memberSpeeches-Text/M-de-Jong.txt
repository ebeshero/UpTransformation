================================
Has it occurred to the Premier, has it occurred to the government, why these rallies are taking place? Do they care? The rallies are taking place because for six years, as Attorney General, as Housing Minister and now as Premier, this Premier has embarked upon a failed ideological social experiment that has compromised the safety of British Columbians. People are saying that enough is enough. They don’t want to be the Premier’s social experiment guinea pigs any longer. They want to feel safe in their communities.

This is Andrea’s reality. Listen to what she says. “I’m now terrified that I may send my children to school and never see them again because of something an addict has left behind. I now have naloxone in my home because the drug epidemic is invading the homes and lives of people with no connection to it.” The Premier’s policies for six years on prolific offenders, on encampments and on drugs have created that reality.

Will the Premier and the government finally acknowledge the disastrous effect of his policies, his failed social experiment, the failed social experiment that has compromised the safety of families across this province, and will he finally take some concrete steps to restore the safety that British Columbia families deserve right across this province?

================================
What the Premier and, sadly, the government don’t want to seem to acknowledge is that there is a made-in-B.C. dimension to this public safety crisis for which the Premier himself is responsible.

I sometimes wonder what world some of these folks are living in. Most people don’t have a police escort that takes them to and from work. The sad reality is that more and more people require one, and it’s because of the policies of this Premier. People are paying the price for purposeful policies advanced by this Premier expanding drug availability instead of focusing on treatment and recovery.

It’s not just failing the addicts, of course; it is failing children like Everleigh and Remington. Again, this is what their mother says. Andrea says: “It’s no longer a matter of if something happens to our children but a matter of when something happens to them.” That is the sad reality.

Enough is enough. Will the Premier speak to Andrea and the frightened, angry British Columbians living across the province and explain why he has allowed his choices, his policies, his social experiment to put their public safety in jeopardy?

================================
Thanks to the minister and the officials accompanying her and assisting her. Just an administrative matter. For the balance of the morning I’ll pose some questions. Our colleague from the Green Party will, for scheduling reasons, resume at one o’clock. I’m not certain what areas he wishes to canvass over the time that we’ve agreed to allocate to him.

I’ll be concentrating on some areas involving — surprise, surprise — public safety and then move from there. I expect that will take us through the balance of the day, but we’ll see how that goes.

We’ll start with a general question to try and contextualize the conversation we’re going to have. In the Attorney’s mind, recognizing that she has assumed this position relatively recently, but she’s now the spokesperson for the government on these important matters: is B.C. a safer place to live today than it was five or six years ago?
================================

================================
Well, to be fair, challenges in this area have existed. They have existed prior to this Attorney General taking her position, prior to this government assuming office, and will undoubtedly continue to exist in the future.

My question was more specific than that, though. Because I have found, over the time that I have spent in this place and elsewhere, that we’re not likely to have any success addressing a problem if we don’t acknowledge that a problem exists.

So I’ll try it again. On a comparative basis with the Attorney General, who has some very specific responsibilities around the criminal justice system and the administration of justice: to her mind, is British Columbia a safer place to live in today than it was five or six years ago?
================================

================================
That was somewhat helpful. In assessing the question of public safety, which I presume the Attorney would agree is a legitimate exercise for us to engage in, in this place and in this committee and during these estimates, what variables would the Attorney direct us to, to render an opinion?
================================

================================
Well I’m going to invite the Attorney to provide a little more specific answer now. Whilst I understand that she occupies a role, and a very important one, but not a singular role. She mentioned her colleagues and the fact that these matters cross ministerial lines. In the case of the criminal justice system, it is a central and determinative role.

I’m trying to ascertain the degree to which the Attorney, as the spokesperson for the government, believes there is a problem. So I can say to the committee…. And the Attorney is correct that we’ve had these conversations in the House in another context that doesn’t lend itself well to a kind of discussion that we can have here.

I can say, or my colleague can say, that we have a criminal justice, public safety, criminal violence problem, but our views on that matter are far less relevant than the Attorney’s. So in determining whether or not there is an issue…. And she has mentioned peripherally some of the things that she and the government believe they could or should do. I first need to know or would like to know, and the committee would like to know, the degree to which she believes there is a problem and on what basis she comes to that conclusion. Surely there are….

If there is a subjective element to this…. But surely it is based in part on actual data. Surely the ministry and, by extension, the minister, in determining whether there is a problem or not, look to certain variables as evidence and would cite that data as either supportive of the proposition that the problem is not as great as the opposition alleges, or it is, in fact….

What are those variables? In the areas for which the ministry and the minister have responsibility, the criminal justice system, surely there are indicators and variables that she looks at to determine whether or not and the extent to which we have a problem. What are they?

================================
I don’t mean to be argumentative, but the minister has now been around this place long enough to know what I am seeking.

I could make a speech for 15 minutes, time and time again, making my allegations. I am far more interested to know whether the Attorney, as the spokesperson for the government in this case, believes we have a public safety issue and, if she does, on what basis she comes to that conclusion. It is for her to say, not me. It is for her to say whether or not we have a public safety issue and point to the areas that convince her that is so — and to put that on the record.
================================

[Proceedings Info: 202304271000-birch:::Proceedings in the Birch Room]
================================
All right. Well, we’re making a little bit of progress here.

I’d like to be more specific. The Attorney, in her answer and in her previous answer, as well, referred to challenges that communities are facing and concerned about. She has indicated that she shares concerns about those challenges.

I’d like her to be more specific about what she sees those challenges to be and whether they have gotten worse. I think those are legitimate questions to pose to the person in charge, the justice minister for the province. Incidents of violent criminal activity. Is it the Attorney’s view that that situation has gotten worse over the course of the last five or six years? Let’s start there.
