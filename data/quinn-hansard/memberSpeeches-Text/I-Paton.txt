================================
Today I’d like to welcome my dear wife, Pam. Some call her the de facto MLA for Delta South, but she does a great job backing me up and looking after our livestock on our farm when I’m not there.

She’s here today with our good friends Scott and Michele Harris from Tsawwassen. Scott has recently retired as a famous nursery owner in Ladner called Harris Nurseryland.

Would everybody please welcome my wife, Pam, and my guests, Scott and Michele.
