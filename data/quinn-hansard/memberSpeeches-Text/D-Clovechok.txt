================================
Thanks to my colleague for the time.

I just want to say at the onset of this…. It’ll be a quick question, but I do want to acknowledge the work that the minister and I have done in my riding from Revelstoke to Kimberley. It’s been successful, and hopefully this question will end up with success as well.

As the minister will know, Columbia River–Revelstoke is a tourism community, by and large. I’m going to use the Columbia Valley as an example of this. Our populations increase dramatically over the summer from May to October. In the Columbia Valley, that population increase is 30,000 to 40,000 people through tourism.

Also, another issue…. That’s the first issue, which is not an issue. We’re very grateful for it.

But also, we’ve got Albertans who are coming and using our emergency in Invermere, a little, tiny eight-bed hospital with amazing docs, nurses and support staff. They’re coming across and using our emergency because they triage at 12, 14 hours in Calgary, so they’re coming to us.

Also, with the new decriminalization of opioids and other drugs, we are expecting, as one policeman told me, the great trek west. We’re going to see people coming. It’s legal in British Columbia now, so we’re assuming that we’re going to see higher usages.

A couple of things come out of that narration. We’re already stretched in terms of our resources. I’m going to be talking to the Public Safety Minister about this, as far as policing, but from a health perspective, we have two cars in Invermere. They’re busy all the time, as you will know. With the increase of population, with the increase of drug usage, which we’re assuming, and the increase of Calgary people coming into our hospitals, huge pressure is being put on our resources.

From May to October, does the minister have any idea or will the minister provide any additional resources for these communities that I represent through those busy times? We don’t have enough.
