[Procedure Type: Introductions by Members]
================================
I wish to introduce some guests joining us in the gallery today: my chief of staff, Krystal Smith, and her family. Her sister and brother-in-law Karla and Jim Leask own GeoTility, a geothermal company based in Kelowna. It does business across North America, including some B.C. schools and, most recently, the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art in California.

Their children are here as well: Jimmy Leask, who works in sales at GeoTility, and Meagan Leask, who works at Allnorth Consultants as a project manager and has worked on projects at Highland Valley Copper and New Afton. They all live in Kelowna.

Would the House please join me in making them very welcome.
