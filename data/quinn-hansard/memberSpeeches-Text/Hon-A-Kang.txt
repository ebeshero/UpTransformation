================================
In the gallery today, I have two special guests. Colin Plant is the chair of the capital regional district, and Ted Robbins is the chief administrative officer. The CRD is a regional local government on southern Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands, and it encompasses 13 municipalities of Greater Victoria and three electoral areas: Saltspring Island electoral area, south Gulf Islands electoral area and Juan de Fuca electoral area. Weâ€™re going to have our first meeting today, and I really look forward to having a great discussion with them.
