================================
Yes. I look forward to the dialogue and the questions from the members opposite. I want to welcome my great team at Attorney General. I’m going to read all their names out, and I want to thank them for their participation and all their hard work.

We have Barbara Carmichael, the Deputy Attorney General; Tracy Campbell; Peter Juk; Jenny Manton; Haiqa Cheema; Colleen Spier; Paul Craven; and Eva Ross. That’s everybody in the room.

I want to thank the member for this very important question. We often talk about it quite a bit, in the House and certainly politically.

I have to say that communities across the country have been dealing with specific challenges when it comes to safety. Those challenges we are responding to in different ways. That is in our safer communities action plan, which has targeted responses to the challenges with safety that communities are coming to us with.

================================
Again, I think the question calls for a very subjective answer. I base my perception on policy directives, and so does everybody in the ministry, based on facts and evidence that we see in communities. We’ve been very public, and I certainly have been, on our focus on repeat violent offenders and the impacts of COVID specifically on communities related to that.

So to that regard, I think the member has heard me very often talk about how we think we need better tools in our justice system to address repeat violent offenders. And then our safer communities action plan is about responding to those impacts of COVID.

================================
Thanks for the question. It’s actually a very broad question. I’m going to start by saying that obviously, my role, as the member knows, in public safety is as Attorney General, so any questions related to the broader Ministry of Public Safety and the choices made for that would be obviously up to Minister Farnworth. But what I can tell you is with the question about what variables we consider with respect to the Attorney General’s office. Of course, that’s varied and very comprehensive and depending on the issue.

First, I would say we have a team of experts within our ministry that have a level of expertise in their area, that are constantly engaging and communicating with front-line workers, assessing programs that are in place. We have, obviously, our independent advisers, like the B.C. Prosecution Service.

Our role is to respond to the needs of the justice system to do the work that it needs to do — for example, making investments for one of the largest calls for Crown counsel resources, so hiring 40 new Crown counsel was a response to some of the needs. Standing up the repeat violent offenders initiative was also a response.

We rely on many actors, some of them independent, some of them internal to the ministry, and many factors. I’m sure we will go into details as we get into different programs and I’ll be able to provide a more specific answer.

================================
I just would like to ask for clarification from the member. I think it would be helpful if we were narrowing. I’ve spoken earlier about how we’ve very publicly — and again, in this committee — talked about what we’re concerned about with repeat violent offenders. So I’m happy to provide the basis for that, for the reasons that we’re taking action on that or calling for reform.

I just want clarity of what the member is asking — if he could narrow it a little bit.

================================
Thanks for the question that the member had. Of course I’m concerned about crime. I think every time we hear about violent offences in the news…. Of course that’s of concern to me, as Attorney General. We have done quite a bit of work to fill the groundwork and to figure out what policy changes we need to make to address that.

To the member’s point about how I use to guide what solutions…. I’m sure the member knows about the LePard-Butler report. It went out there and really examined the holistic approach to what’s needed to address crime, specifically the violent offender.

My piece of it, as Attorney General — I can speak to that; I can’t speak to the other ministries that were involved in the other part of it — is to make sure that the justice system has the tools that it needs to respond to the types of crime we’re seeing. That, as I think the member has heard me say many times, led us to ask for reform to the bail system. It led us to stand up the repeat offenders intervention initiative, which is focused on the justice system better circling around repeat violent offenders, and a number of other initiatives held by other ministries that are part of it. That’s under our safer communities action plan.
================================

================================
I think I’ve been clear by saying that I do have concerns about very specific types of criminal acts. I think our government has been clear about our concerns, and that’s why they’ve informed our actions.

Now, the reason that we’ve come to that is…. We’ve worked with urban mayors. We worked with experts like LePard-Butler. We take advice from the experts and the independent ones in our justice system. Again, my job as Attorney General is to make sure that the justice system has the tools that it needs to respond to the challenges, no matter what they are.

Communities across the country have seen the impacts of COVID. It’s not uncommon to hear about acts, whether it’s transit in Toronto or…. When I met with the other Attorneys General and public safety ministers across the country, when we went to Ottawa, they all raised very specific concerns about the impacts of COVID and how that’s showing up with people. I think it was bear spray in Manitoba. There are very specific challenges that each community is facing.

We respond by hearing and listening to what’s happening in communities. What I’ve heard from mayors and councils and, certainly, our part of the justice system side of that is…. It is a small group of people that are causing the repeat offences. That’s why our programs are designed to invest, at least on the justice system side, and to bolster the resources — to address that but also to call upon the federal government for better tools.

With that, I move that the committee rise, report progress and ask leave to sit again.
