                    <dialogue>I wish to introduce some guests joining us in the gallery today: my
                        chief of staff, Krystal Smith, and her family. Her sister and brother-in-law
                        Karla and Jim Leask own GeoTility, a geothermal company based in Kelowna. It
                        does business across North America, including some B.C. schools and, most
                        recently, the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art in California.</dialogue>
                    <dialogue>Their children are here as well: Jimmy Leask, who works in sales at
                        GeoTility, and Meagan Leask, who works at Allnorth Consultants as a project
                        manager and has worked on projects at Highland Valley Copper and New Afton.
                        They all live in Kelowna.</dialogue>
                    <dialogue>Would the House please join me in making them very welcome.</dialogue>

                    <dialogue>Today in the gallery is somebody very familiar to us, Dr Julian
                        Somers, a world-renowned clin&#0173;ical psychologist and professor of
                        health sciences at Simon Fraser University. His work, of course, addresses
                        social policies, clinical practices to aim to reduce homelessness and crime
                        involving people who are struggling with addiction. He’s also here to
                        participate in the Enough Is Enough rally with his son Nicholas.</dialogue>
                    <dialogue>Now, Nicholas, a young man who is here to support his dad, wants to
                        demonstrate that young voters want to see more action. He is a UBC urban
                        forestry student and will be documenting the rally in order to spread the
                        Enough Is Enough message far and wide across this province.</dialogue>
                    <dialogue>I ask the House to please make them both welcome.</dialogue>

                    <dialogue>Joining us in the House today are three guests from UBC’s Political
                        Science Student Association. James LaRose is the outgoing president, while
                        Anouska Gautam and Nicole Mendoza are the incoming co-presidents. It’s
                        always a pleasure to see students take on leadership roles to serve their
                        community, and I thank them for their hard work.</dialogue><dialogue>Would the House please join
                        me in welcoming them here.</dialogue>

                    <dialogue>Last year I was leaving my apartment here in Victoria and somebody was
                        yelling my name, which is not unusual. In this case, it was friends from
                        Kitimat, who actually moved to Victoria. They were both born and raised in
                        Kitimat, B.C. They spent their working careers with Rio Tinto Alcan, which
                        is an aluminum smelter, both in Kitimat and Kemano. Kemano is the power
                        source for the smelter in Kitimat. They chose to retire to Victoria,
                        B.C.</dialogue>
                    <dialogue>Susan and Perry Minaker live just up the street from us with their
                        dog, who I’ve met as well. They also have a son, who is a retinal surgeon
                        currently working at Chicago Rush Hospital in the U.S.A., and a daughter,
                        who is a pharmacist and currently working for Shoppers Drug Mart and lives
                        also in Victoria, B.C.</dialogue>
                    <dialogue>Would the House please make them feel welcome.</dialogue>

                    <dialogue>Take Our Kids to Work Day is a great opportunity for students to get
                        some experience seeing what a work environment is like, and it’s also a
                        great chance for parents and intergenerational connections. Joining us in
                        the House today are several grade 9 students and their parents and
                        caregivers who happen to work for the Ministry of Environment and Climate
                        Change Strategy. They’re here for Take Our Kids to Work Day.</dialogue>
                    <dialogue>Joining us are Caleb Jonker, Jennifer Jonker, Erin McIntosh, Meara
                        McIntosh, Eloise Burns, Sharilynn Wardrop, Faye Quin, Melissa Quin, Jillian

                    <dialogue>Today I’d like to welcome my dear wife, Pam. Some call her the de
                        facto MLA for Delta South, but she does a great job backing me up and
                        looking after our livestock on our farm when I’m not there.</dialogue>
                    <dialogue>She’s here today with our good friends Scott and Michele Harris from
                        Tsawwassen. Scott has recently retired as a famous nursery owner in Ladner
                        called Harris Nurseryland.</dialogue>
                    <dialogue>Would everybody please welcome my wife, Pam, and my guests, Scott and

                    <dialogue>In the gallery today, I have two special guests. Colin Plant is the
                        chair of the capital regional district, and Ted Robbins is the chief
                        administrative officer. The CRD is a regional local government on southern
                        Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands, and it encompasses 13 municipalities
                        of Greater Victoria and three electoral areas: Saltspring Island electoral
                        area, south Gulf Islands electoral area and Juan de Fuca electoral area.
                        We’re going to have our first meeting today, and I really look forward to
                        having a great discussion with them.</dialogue>

                    <member tocID="tt3816">M. Lee</member>
                    <dialogue>I would like to, on behalf of the Minister of Municipal Affairs and
                        myself, welcome two guests that we have in the gallery here today behind me,
                        I understand. That is Chris Chan and Stella Chan. Chris and Stella recently
                        participated in the 50th anniversary gala, which the Minister of Municipal
                        Affairs and myself were at, for SUCCESS. They’re celebrating 50 years, as
                        both the members for Richmond-Queensborough and Richmond North Centre have
                        commemorated in this place, in terms of the importance of SUCCESS as an
                        organization.</dialogue>
                    <dialogue>Stella is someone who has been the honorary chair of the SHINE
                        Mother’s Day Tea gala, as well as the founding chair. She has also been the
                        co-chair of the Chinese-Canadian Miracle Weekend committee of the B.C.
                        Children’s Hospital Foundation. She serves on the board of directors for
                        Women in Primerica, an organization.</dialogue>
                    <dialogue>Chris Chan is the managing broker of Regent Park Realty. He served on
                        the board of directors for St. Mark’s College at the University of British
                        Columbia’s Corpus Christi College. Members that participated yesterday in
                        the Parliamentary Reform Committee were addressing some potential changes to
                        their governing legislation. He’s also a past vice-chair of the SUCCESS
                        foundation.</dialogue>
                    <dialogue>One other note that I wanted to make here is that Chris and Stella
                        clearly are just other good examples of individuals that have strong
                        professional careers but also do a lot to give back to community. That’s
                        been a fine example to their son, Arthur, who, as some of you may know, was
                        diagnosed with leukemia at the age of 3½ years old. He spent the next 3½
                        years in chemo and made a full recovery. He is a healthy and strong Sauder
                        grad at UBC. He is also the president and co-founder of another organization
                        called Dare to Dream Destiny Foundation, which was founded in 2015 and
                        strives for progressive change in society.</dialogue>
                    <dialogue>I would just ask all members of this House to join me and the Minister
                        of Municipal Affairs to welcome Chris and Stella Chan to our
                        House.</dialogue>

                    <dialogue>We have a number of representatives today from the Filipino community
                        across British Columbia. They are here to mark April 27, which will be
                        proclaimed as Lapu-Lapu Day. I’m not going to introduce everybody
                        individually, but I would like to give a very warm welcome to the Philippine
                        consul general, Arlene Magno; the Philippine Consulate General cultural
                        officer, Maria Lyra Ocampo; and Philippine consulate staff, Arnel
                        Anacion.</dialogue>
                    <dialogue>I invite all members of the House to join at 11:30 at the Rattenbury

                        practising human rights lawyer who was formerly with the Ontario Human
                        Rights Tribunal. She now lives in Nanaimo with her family and rescue dog,

                        invitation, when I was in Dr. Andrew Wender’s class, to come and shadow me
                        for the day.</dialogue>
                    <dialogue>Eakam Dhillon is currently completing a degree in history, which made
                        me very excited, and minoring in political science. Her interest includes
                        soccer and volunteering at Punjabi school to help younger generations read,

                        from the Cowichan Valley. Now, Jon is a highly regarded Indigenous business
                        and community leader. Sadly Jon continues to be sidelined from working in
                        his own traditional territory on the Cowichan hospital.</dialogue>
                    <dialogue>Jon is here today to participate in the Enough Is Enough rally. John
                        is a father. He’s a grandfather. He has significant concerns about the
                        increasing housing affordability and opioid crisis that is
                        disproportionately negatively impacting Indigenous peoples.</dialogue>

                    <dialogue>As most people know, every time I have an opportunity to stand up in
                        this House and brag about the amazing district of Tumbler Ridge, I think
                        it’s a great opportunity to do so again.</dialogue>
                    <dialogue>Today the district of Tumbler Ridge has won the Canadian rights to be
                        known now as SledTown ShowDown winners, as the best place to be in Canada to
                        go snowmobiling. So people like myself and others…. I invite you up to that
                        region to come and enjoy the most beautiful part of the province, I would
                        say, up in the Tumbler Ridge area.</dialogue>
                    <dialogue>With that, it’s my pleasure to welcome to the House today…. We have
                        Darryl Krakowka, the mayor of Tumbler Ridge, who is with us today; his
                        executive assistant, Karen Curry; and the executive director for the Tumbler
                        Ridge Museum, who is also here today, Zena Conlin.</dialogue>
                    <dialogue>I want the House to welcome them and thank the ministers who have

                    <dialogue>In the House today we have Collen Middleton. Collen Middleton is an
                        environmental scientist with over 18 years in the professional consulting
                        services industry. He got involved in public safety advocacy after moving to
                        south Nanaimo two years ago with his wife and two young boys. Upon
                        discovering how unsafe the streets in his neighbourhood had become in the
                        years prior to moving to the city, he felt unable to sit idly by and watch
                        it continued to deteriorate.</dialogue>
                    <dialogue>Collen Middleton is also here to participate in the Enough Is Enough
                        rally that’s going to happen on the Legislature lawn today. Collen is the
                        founder and president of the Nanaimo Area Public Safety Association and is
                        determined to see crime and street disorder improve in his city through
                        advocacy and activism. He and his association will rattle whatever cages
                        they need to, to improve the situation on the streets for the sake of his
                        family, neighbours, fellow citizens of Nanaimo and British Columbians
                        broadly.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>On April 28, we recognize the National Day of Mourning, a solemn
                            day to honour and remember those who have lost their lives or been
                            injured in the workplace. On behalf of the official opposition, I stand
                            before you to express my deepest condolences to the families and friends
                            of those workers who have lost their lives while trying to earn a living
                            for their loved ones.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>The tragic crane collapse in downtown Kelowna less than two years
                            ago claimed the lives of five workers. This heartbreaking incident is
                            not an isolated case, as 181 people in British Columbia lost their lives
                            due to work-related injuries and illnesses last year.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>On this day of mourning, reflection and remembrance, we renew our
                            commitment to creating safer and healthier workplaces for everyone. As
                            we remember those we have lost, we must recognize the importance of
                            providing workers with adequate protection and access to necessary
                            resources when they are hurt or become ill.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Government must take a proactive approach to ensure employers
                            provide workers with a safe and supportive workplace. This includes
                            providing the necessary resources and tools to promote the well-being of
                            all employees, employers and stakeholders.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Since 1991, British Columbia has joined the rest of Canada in
                            recognizing the National Day of Mourning by observing moments of
                            silence, wearing ribbons, lighting candles and finding other ways to
                            remember those that we have lost. Today I encourage all of us to find
                            our own way of remembering those we’ve lost and standing with the loved
                            ones and survivors.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Tomorrow let us take a moment to reflect on those we have lost and
                            let us honour their memory by recommitting ourselves to building a safer
                            and more supportive workplace for all British Columbians.</dialogue>

                            Summerland’s Rob Robinson and Kevin Maxwell from Victoria. This
                            foursome, after winning the provincial championship, headed to Prince

                            only to both northern Ontario and southern Ontario. They beat Alberta in
                            the semifinal and then ended up facing northern Ontario again in the
                            final game, where they prevailed, with a score of 8-6, to bring the gold

                        <dialogue>What happens to wildlife that inhabited a forested area that’s
                            about to be clearcut logged? Well, here’s my observations, after more
                            than 50 years as an outdoorsman. For any of the 81 species that den or
                            nest in tree cavities, they are often killed in the process as they take
                            shelter in those cavities, an environment that they deem safe. Many
                            species reside in ground cavities and are crushed.</dialogue>
                        <timestamp>1025</timestamp>
                        <dialogue>For birds and fur-bearers that flee the area into adjacent forest
                            cover, they are faced with new challenges. Most species are territorial,
                            protecting their food source and their habitat with their life. A fight
                            to the death is not uncommon.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>For species that flee into adjacent areas previously clearcut,
                            they become susceptible to starvation and exposure due to lack of
                            habitat. Suitable habitat can take more than a century of growth before
                            it once again supports these species.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>The Migratory Birds Convention Act, a 100-year-old treaty between
                            Canada, the United States and Mexico, prohibits disturbing any bird
                            nests from May until August inclusive in British Columbia. Yet according
                            to a study published in 2014, an estimated 400,000 bird nests are
                            destroyed during this period each year from clearcutting. Millions of
                            hectares of forest have been clearcut in British Columbia in the past 50
                            years.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Raptors such as owls, goshawks and eagles use stick nests, located
                            near the tops of mature trees. It’s an offence under B.C.’s Wildlife Act
                            to destroy stick nests at any time, yet thousands of these nests have
                            disappeared.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>To add insult to injury, once an area is clearcut, glyphosate is
                            often used to kill the deciduous and broadleaf growth, a critical food
                            source for most insects and wildlife.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Wildlife displaced from clearcut logging stands little to no
                            chance of survival. No wonder B.C.’s wildlife populations have
                            plummeted.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>This book came to fruition with the help of a multiculturalism

                            book to all elementary schools in B.C. and are working towards another
                            book next year. In the meantime, they’re taking on other

                            The goal of the exhibition is to educate the public on why
                            multiculturalism and diversity are important and why there’s no place in

                        <dialogue>I’ve noted several times the administration and financial burden
                            this government puts on Indigenous communities through our consultation
                            policies. The steady flow of referrals comes with meagre financial
                            resources, time constrained to 30 days to respond and a policy of
                            silence being compliance.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>My heart here is for my relatives, who work so hard on behalf of
                            our communities — one or two often showing up to meetings with
                            government officials, sitting across the table from a half dozen
                            technical staff from the ministry. Then, after only a short break, they
                            find themselves at yet another table, on a different topic and with a
                            new group of government workers — always outnumbered, always
                            out-resourced.</dialogue>
                        <timestamp>1030</timestamp>
                        <dialogue>They inspire me to stand in here and demand government recognize
                            the crushing workload that we are creating and the psychological trauma
                            that is sustained from it. We love our communities, and we want to
                            flourish. We are proud and passionate, and as the government referrals
                            clog our in-boxes, it’s overwhelming.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>When legislation is introduced, it creates another stream of
                            consultation referrals. The minister introducing that legislation should
                            be required to have the resources that can be provided to First Nations
                            to do their technical and their legal work, because it makes for better
                            work.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>Today, April 27, will be proclaimed as Lapu-Lapu Day in
                            B.C.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>The history of the Philippines is a saga of unrelenting resistance
                            against foreign colonization and domination. It is an unbroken epic of
                            struggle for freedom, self-determination, independence and national
                            sovereignty.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>The Philippines was a colony of Spain for more than 300 years.
                            Based on historical accounts, at least 200 revolts broke out during this
                            time. Filipinos took up arms to rebel against the imposition of levies,
                            forced labour, land grabbing, commercial monopolies and other unjust
                            practices. These uprisings culminated in a nationalist revolution, which
                            succeeded in 1898, with the declaration of national independence by the
                            Philippines.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I recall all of these, because the struggle against foreign
                            subjugation began on the shores of Mactan-Cebu in central Philippines,
                            my mom’s home province, where an Indigenous leader named Lapu-Lapu
                            refused to bow down to Spanish rule. On April 27, 1521, Lapu-Lapu and
                            his warriors repulsed a Spanish expeditionary force, commanded by
                            Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, in an assertion of liberty
                            against foreign rule, and 502 years ago this day, Lapu-Lapu stood
                            unbowed before invaders, so that he and his people could remain
                            free.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Lapu-Lapu is thus recognized as the first national and Indigenous
                            hero, with April 27 designated as a special holiday in the
                            Philippines.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>The legacy of Lapu-Lapu runs deep in the psyche of Filipinos. It
                            lives in their deep-seated value of <em>bayanihan</em>, which is made up
                            of two words: <em>bayan</em>, which means community, and
                            <em>bayani</em>, which means hero. <em>Bayanihan</em> is the communal
                            desire and act of helping one another, of being connected with
                            others.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I’d like to extend an invitation for everyone here to join the
                            proclamation at 11:30 in the Rattenbury Room and 2 p.m. on Saturday at

                            talented Francis Matheu.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>Today in British Columbia, the public is forced to confront daily
                            incidents of shootings, vandalism, brutal random assaults and rampant
                            lawlessness. The responsibility for this explosion of violence and
                            social disorder falls squarely on the shoulders of this soft-on-crime
                            Premier.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>This crisis began during his five years as Attorney General,
                            marked by his catch-and-release program that allows violent prolific
                            offenders to act with total impunity, knowing they’ll be released right
                            back into the community.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>His decisions as Housing Minister to warehouse those with severe
                            mental health and addiction issues, without any proper supports, into
                            communities over local community opposition and his utter failure to
                            address encampments and violence in tent cities have only made the
                            crisis worse. Now he’s adding more fuel to the crisis with his reckless
                            decriminalization and disregard for police chiefs’ concerns with the
                            open, public use of crystal meth, heroin, cocaine and

                            record, his policy choices, that are causing the crime, chaos and open
                            drug use that have parents like Andrea and those outside this

                        <dialogue>I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. This
                            government, as every government across this country, takes the issue of
                            public safety and the challenges that we have seen of some of the
                            increase in crime rates very seriously.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>That’s why it was this government that led the charge at the
                            federal level to get changes to the Criminal Code when it comes to bail,
                            to expand the terms of reverse onus, so that it’s not just for firearms
                            but is in fact a much broader definition of a weapon used in violent
                            crime and also taking into account previous violence by the
                            offender.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>We worked with other Premiers of political stripes right across
                            this country. The federal government, the Justice Minister made a
                            commitment to us that those changes would be put in place in this
                            legislative session in Ottawa.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>At the same time, this government, as the member well knows, has
                            done what we can do in the province, investing the largest amount of
                            money into new police officers for small rural communities across the
                            province, the specialized investigation teams that are crucial, the
                            largest investment in RCMP funding. There’s over $1 billion in the
                            budget for mental health supports right across the full spectrum, and
                            housing initiatives.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>We take this issue very seriously. People in this province deserve
                            to feel safe, and we will continue to make sure that they
                            are.</dialogue>

                            actual results instead of rhetoric. The fact of the matter is that our
                            streets, our cafés, buses and even schools have become as unsafe as they
                            have ever been.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Little Everleigh, from Nanaimo, innocently believing that the bag
                            of fentanyl, which she’d found in her elementary school playground,
                            looked cute, carried it home in her backpack to show her younger brother
                            Remington.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Under the family’s kitchen table, her mother, Andrea, discovered
                            her two young children attempting to open this deadly bag of fentanyl.
                            Andrea says: “My child and her two-year-old brother she was playing with
                            would have died had they ingested the substance. A few days later, a
                            significant amount of drug-related items — pipes, uncapped syringes,
                            drug bags, used tinfoil, tie-offs, etc. — were found in the hedges where
                            our children line up for class and play during recess.”</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Something is terribly wrong when our children can’t go out to play
                            at recess without putting their lives at risk. The public is saying
                            enough is enough.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>My question is this. When are Andrea and the folks in this gallery
                            who are demanding to know, from this Premier…? How many lives must be
                            put at risk before this Premier stands up, does his job and puts the
                            safety of the community before his own radical agenda?</dialogue>

                            illegal today, and the police do their job every day to ensure that
                            those individuals are arrested.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>What I also want to make clear is that this government has been

                        <dialogue>…to put police in communities is not a radical agenda. Putting in
                            place a witness protection program that has resulted in prosecution
                            after prosecution and the solving of cold cases is not a radical
                            agenda.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Putting in place a forensic firearms lab so that police are able
                            to build a stronger case is not a radical agenda. Putting in place more
                            than $1 billion for mental health supports is not a radical agenda.
                            Putting in place housing initiatives, which did not take place when that
                            side sat on this side, is not a radical agenda.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>It is a public safety agenda, designed to put in place the tools
                            police have asked for, working with local communities to put in place
                            the resources that they have been needing, and at the same time going to
                            Ottawa.</dialogue>

                            Code changed, so that those who are violent offenders are not given
                            bail. That is not a radical agenda. That is a public safety agenda that
                            we will continue.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>Has it occurred to the Premier, has it occurred to the government,
                            why these rallies are taking place? Do they care? The rallies are taking
                            place because for six years, as Attorney General, as Housing Minister
                            and now as Premier, this Premier has embarked upon a failed ideological
                            social experiment that has compromised the safety of British Columbians.
                            People are saying that enough is enough. They don’t want to be the
                            Premier’s social experiment guinea pigs any longer. They want to feel
                            safe in their communities.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>This is Andrea’s reality. Listen to what she says. “I’m now
                            terrified that I may send my children to school and never see them again
                            because of something an addict has left behind. I now have naloxone in
                            my home because the drug epidemic is invading the homes and lives of
                            people with no connection to it.” The Premier’s policies for six years
                            on prolific offenders, on encampments and on drugs have created that
                            reality.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Will the Premier and the government finally acknowledge the
                            disastrous effect of his policies, his failed social experiment, the
                            failed social experiment that has compromised the safety of families
                            across this province, and will he finally take some concrete steps to
                            restore the safety that British Columbia families deserve right across
                            this province?</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>I appreciate the question from the member, who also sat on this
                            side of the House and who, as Attorney General, when he was Attorney
                            General, knows that the Criminal Code is a federal
                            responsibility.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>He also knows, as does the opposition, the challenges that we face
                            in this province and that every other province is facing when it comes
                            to the issues of violence and public safety. We have seen it on our
                            transit system here and in Edmonton and Calgary and Toronto, right
                            across this country. It’s why this government has worked with other
                            provinces to get the federal government to change the Criminal Code.
                            That is taking place.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>At the same time, we also know, on the social side in terms of the
                            opioid epidemic, which was taking place when they sat on this side of
                            the House, that it’s taking place again right across this
                            country.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>The member will know that this side of the House worked on the
                            all-party committee to come up with solutions, initiatives and
                            approaches, which all of us in this chamber agreed upon. Many of those
                            things have been implemented. Decriminalization was part of
                            that.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>At the same time, we also know that there needed to be significant
                            increase in mental health services and supports — $1 billion in this
                            budget to do just that. Whether it is the social side or the enforcement
                            side, all four pillars are required to deal with this challenge that we
                            face in this province. This government is putting the tools in place
                            that police need and that health authorities need. We are doing
                            everything we can to ensure that our communities are safe.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>What the Premier and, sadly, the government don’t want to seem to
                            acknowledge is that there is a made-in-B.C. dimension to this public
                            safety crisis for which the Premier himself is responsible.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I sometimes wonder what world some of these folks are living in.
                            Most people don’t have a police escort that takes them to and from work.
                            The sad reality is that more and more people require one, and it’s
                            because of the policies of this Premier. People are paying the price for
                            purposeful policies advanced by this Premier expanding drug availability
                            instead of focusing on treatment and recovery.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>It’s not just failing the addicts, of course; it is failing
                            children like Everleigh and Remington. Again, this is what their mother
                            says. Andrea says: “It’s no longer a matter of if something happens to
                            our children but a matter of when something happens to them.” That is
                            the sad reality.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Enough is enough. Will the Premier speak to Andrea and the
                            frightened, angry British Columbians living across the province and
                            explain why he has allowed his choices, his policies, his social
                            experiment to put their public safety in jeopardy?</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>I appreciate the question from my colleague across the way. I have
                            pointed out to this House the initiatives undertaken by our government,
                            that our Premier has led, in terms of ensuring that we are doing
                            everything we can in terms of public safety by working with the police,
                            the men and women on the ground who deal with these situations every
                            day, and giving them the tools that they, the experts on the street, ask
                            for.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>We have worked with local governments to deal with the specific
                            challenges that they face in their individual communities. That’s why we
                            put in place the hubs across the province, the 12 hubs. It’s why we’ve
                            expanded the car program, the mental health supports, the peer-assisted
                            care teams, and we will continue to do that. It’s also why, as I’ve
                            said, we went to Ottawa to get changes to the Criminal Code.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>But it is much more than that that’s required. It’s also dealing
                            with the mental health side of things. Since this government took
                            office, in 2017, not only have we been investing in mental health
                            supports, but we have also been undoing the damage, the very damage
                            that….</dialogue>

                            program in the Fraser Valley. We didn’t cut the social work budget in
                            the Fraser health region. We didn’t close the Waddell’s Haven Guest Home
                            in Mission, a residential mental health facility that provides addiction
                            services. We didn’t close the 11 residential care beds at Bear Creek
                            Lodge, at Newton Regency in Surrey.</dialogue>

                            the Mental Health Act in our province, we know there have been a number
                            of recommendations that have come forward to ensure that the operation
                            of the Mental Health Act works in a better way for people who are
                            involuntarily committed under the act as well as those clinicians who

                        <dialogue>I was listening to the Minister of Mental Health and Addictions,
                            and that was a long way of not saying no.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>The reality is that the two committees that have made
                            recommendations didn’t make recommendations to ensure the operation of
                            the act. Those two committees called for a full review of the Mental
                            Health Act. The language was very clear. It had nothing to do with
                            ensuring the operation of the act.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>In fact, the Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General chose
                            to talk about how effective that committee process was on a variety of
                            other issues around policing. So what we have is a government that is
                            picking and choosing the recommendations that suit their purpose, rather
                            than listening to the good work that’s done by members from all sides of
                            this House.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>We’re expanding access to mental health care, investing billions
                            of dollars in an outdated act. Our understanding of mental health and
                            substance use disorders has changed drastically in the last decade, yet
                            B.C.’s Mental Health Act hasn’t been substantially updated for 60
                            years.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>We can’t rely on a broken legislative framework while trying to
                            tackle a modern mental health crisis. Stakeholders, advocates, experts,
                            officers of the Legislature, including the Ombudsperson and the
                            Representative for Children and Youth, and two committees of this House
                            have tasked this government with updating the Mental Health Act. The
                            most recent recommended a comprehensive review within six months of the
                            report’s release — that was the Health Committee — meaning Monday, May
                            1, of this year.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>My question is again to the Premier. Will this government heed the
                            advice of the stakeholders, the experts, the all-party committees and
                            urgently initiate a full review of B.C.’s Mental Health Act?</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>Again, I’m grateful for the member’s question and for the advocacy
                            and for all of the work that has been done by the select standing
                            committee, by experts, by all of the clinicians and advocates out in
                            community and in our health authorities who provide input, who provide
                            recommendations, around work that we know is necessary to do in terms of
                            improving how people who are experiencing mental health distress, who
                            are struggling with addictions, are receiving care in our health care
                            system.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>We are doing the work to make improvements across the system. We
                            have brought in the rights adviser. We are working with Health Justice
                            on providing better support for clinicians. We know there is much more
                            work to do, and we are doing that work.</dialogue>

                            of crime, chaos and social disorder occurring in this province. Now, two
                            terms and six years later, when that fire is burning out of control,
                            they’re finally, finally trying to scramble to put the fire

                            across this province. He’s present in the gallery today, and he says
                            that the Premier’s policies have “created a monster, a positive feedback

                            doubled in that community. Just yesterday a popular downtown coffee shop
                            had its windows smashed, and that was the seventh time it’s been

                            officers, do an amazing job every single day. The mental health workers
                            in our province do an incredible job every single day. This government
                            gives those men and women the tools that they have been asking for to do
                            that job.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>It is this government — under the leadership of our Premier and
                            Attorney General, when he was Attorney General — that went to Ottawa. We
                            put on the table, we put on the agenda, the need to make changes to the
                            Criminal Code to deal with the unintended consequences of the changes
                            that were made to the Criminal Code when it came to bail
                            reform.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>We said: “We’re experiencing an increase in violence. It’s related
                            to those changes — the inability to keep people behind bars when they
                            should be.” Other provinces agreed with us. Whether it was Alberta,
                            Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, we were all on the same
                            page.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>We made it clear that changes need to be made. We received the
                            commitment from the federal government to get those change so that we
                            have an expanded definition on reverse onus so that if you’re using a
                            weapon, you could be denied bail; if you have a history of violence, you
                            could be denied bail. Those are changes that police wanted to see. Those
                            are changes that we asked for. Those are changes that we’re going to
                            get. We are committed to making communities safe, and we’ll do
                            everything we can to ensure that happens.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>I agree with the Solicitor General. Police are doing a great job.
                            Police are doing a great job, and it’s this government that is failing
                            the police, failing them, failing to address the social and behavioural
                            issues that are causing chaos, failing to address the substance use
                            issues in this province, failing to provide the direction needed by the
                            courts in this province. Enough is enough. Enough is enough. People

                        <dialogue>When will this soft-on-crime Premier end his catch-and-release
                            justice system? At the rally in Penticton, they say: “Rampant crime has
                            left us feeling victimized, and pervasive evidence of homelessness has
                            resulted in each of us feeling hopeless and vulnerable. Our concerns lie
                            in the total lack of appropriate and successful management of those
                            issues by the government.”</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Penticton is the community that the Premier threatened as Housing
                            Minister. He bullied the community, saying that if they didn’t accept
                            his plan to warehouse people with severe mental health and addictions
                            issues without proper supports, that he would send 1,000 tents and
                            sleeping bags to create a tent city.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>What does this Premier have to say to communities like Penticton
                            and Nanaimo who are now suffering the ongoing consequences of his failed

                            seriously, from putting in place the very tools that police have been

                        <dialogue>Right from day one, we put in place the witness security program,

                            more than 32 cold case convictions of individuals being charged and now
                            behind bars where they belong. Putting in place the first forensic

                            firearms lab saved police time and money, and it allowed them to build
                            stronger cases to put those kinds of people behind bars where they
                            belong.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>The largest investment in policing in the history of this province
                            to hire 277 additional RCMP officers for communities right across the
                            province, communities that that side of the House asked for, whether it
                            is Kelowna, whether it is Cranbrook, whether it is Terrace. That’s where
                            they’re going — to those communities. This side of the House is taking
                            action, and we will continue to take action to ensure our communities
                            are safe.</dialogue>

                            world from the Public Safety Minister doesn’t take away the fact that we
                            have terrible results by every single measure in British
                            Columbia.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Let’s just take it back to results. We have more overdose deaths
                            than ever before in the province’s history. We have more people on the
                            streets, homeless, than ever before in the province’s history. We have
                            more violent, random attacks taking place in communities right across
                            this province than ever before. We have 40 percent fewer people in jail
                            today under this government than when they came to office. We have more
                            vandalism and crime and social disorder taking place all over British

                        <dialogue>People have had enough. They’ve had enough with the soft-on-crime
                            Premier’s catch-and-release policies. They’ve had enough of the
                            Premier’s deliberate policy to warehouse people without supports.
                            British Columbians have had enough of the Premier careening British
                            Columbia down the path of decriminalization without the guardrails that
                            were promised. British Columbians have had enough.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Just yesterday Victoria residents at the local Quadra Heights
                            playground were accosted by two people who proceeded to dig out a
                            crossbow that they had stashed under the merry-go-round at the
                            playground. “We thought that they were looking for lost drugs, but no,
                            they pulled out a crossbow. I couldn’t believe it. I’m still shaken up
                            by it. I went to work and I still couldn’t calm down, so I came home.”
                            This happened at a children’s playground. Parents and families expect
                            this government to do way better than what is the current
                            reality.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>My question to the Premier is this. How many more British
                            Columbians need to be put at risk of violence, literally endangered in
                            their neighbourhoods, in parks, in playgrounds and stores and transit
                            buses? How many more have to face that reality before this soft-on-crime
                            Premier puts an end to his failed policies, does his job and gets
                            serious about prioritizing the safety of British Columbians?</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>I appreciate the question from the member. Everyone deserves to be
                            safe, and no one should have to deal with the situation that the member
                            outlined. I can tell the honourable member that the two individuals that
                            dug up that weapon were, in fact, arrested by the police. I hope that
                            they are charged.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I’ve also outlined the actions that this government is taking by
                            working with police, working with communities, working with the federal
                            government. I want to remind that member, because he was a cabinet
                            minister at one time, that the Criminal Code is not a policy. The
                            Criminal Code of Canada is federal law. Rulings are made by the Supreme
                            Court of Canada. That’s not a policy; that’s a fact.</dialogue>
                        <timestamp>1105</timestamp>
                        <dialogue>What I can tell you is that we’ve needed changes to that Criminal
                            Code, and it is this side of the House that has pushed to get those
                            changes and a commitment from the federal government to change it so
                            that those kinds of individuals can be held.</dialogue>

                            recognizing that you make investments early on, what did that member and
                            his colleagues think when they sat on this side of the House and cut
                            $187½ million from child and family protection, or $34½ million from
                            youth justice, youth services and youth and child mental health? Those

                        <dialogue>Again, I’ll recognize…. I am well aware that there are a lot of
                            clauses to do with the Greenhouse Gas Industrial Reporting and Control
                            Act within Bill 10. We go up to clause 46, and we’re only on 19. I may
                            be touching on a clause that might be ahead, but it’s still on the same
                            theme.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I’m just trying to get some better understanding of the process
                            the minister is planning on embarking on when the bill gets enacted,
                            given that we’re going to be in, best-case scenario, a year’s worth of
                            limbo as we try to bring on board the OBPS system that these sections
                            are going to lay the groundwork for.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>The first process that B.C. was operating under, in terms of
                            industrial credits — it would be net 30 of the greenhouse gas tax or
                            carbon tax — actually wound up being a year or two behind schedule, by
                            the time all the negotiations were done between the government and the
                            individual industries on coming up with what was deemed to be an
                            agreed-upon, world-leading emissions standard that the industry would
                            have to meet to be able to qualify to pay $30 a tonne in carbon tax
                            instead of $50.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>We don’t have the OBPS in front of us. It’s still being crafted
                            and worked on. It’s my understanding those discussions still need to
                            take place, in terms of how this will all work within British
                            Columbia.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>What is the timeline — the minister’s expectation — to have this
                            in place and to be ready for next year’s budget — and, more importantly,
                            so that industry also knows what to expect heading into next year’s
                            budget?</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>I’ll get into the dollars side of this whole sphere in estimates,
                            recognizing that this isn’t estimates. It’s more to deal with the
                            technical side of implementation.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>In terms of the work that will be undertaken, I’m assuming, by
                            this ministry but also by the Ministry of Environment or other
                            ministries…. The Ministry of Finance seems to be appropriate for setting
                            out these schedules of emissions standards.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>It seems that there still needs to be a lot of work done in terms
                            of consultation with industry. There are also business groups seeking to
                            be afforded the opportunity to provide their input. Is it the
                            expectation of the minister that the feedback being sought, and the
                            discussions that will happen, to develop the OBPS system will be
                            strictly industry-based? Will there also be industry associations
                            meaningfully worked with as well?</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I’ll cite one in particular. The Business Council of B.C. has
                            actually written to the province, seeking consultation on the
                            OBPS.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>Part of the other concern that we’ve been hearing is that this
                            will be done in an open and transparent way. We’ve heard that from both
                            industry but we’ve also heard it from environmental groups trying to get
                            an understanding of how this will be rolled out, how those discussions
                            and what the inputs into the final decisions are and how they are
                            arrived at.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Will the groups that are being engaged with be required to be
                            signing NDAs or will they be free to discuss, with their associations
                            and the broader public, updates of where they feel things are heading
                            with discussions with government?</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>It’s fair to say it would be considered on a case-by-case basis.
                            It will depend on the nature and the stage of consultation. If we’re
                            doing just information gathering then probably don’t need an NDA…. As
                            the consultation goes further along on draft regulations, for instance,
                            those are typically done under NDA.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Particularly, we have to be concerned that we’re not sharing
                            information that could actually be used as insider information, because
                            it’s a tax bill. We want to make sure that if we are having those
                            discussions, that they are under NDA if it’s required.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>Certainly I think we all recognize the need for some, especially
                            on the protected information, especially on an industry when its
                            competitive.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>That kind of leads into my next question around competitiveness,
                            because that’s a key piece of all of this. How we keep British Columbia
                            industry competitive with the rest of North America and, indeed, the
                            world? Especially when you’re talking natural resources. It truly is a
                            global market you’re competing with a lot of times, depending on the
                            commodity.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>It appears that this year…. Again, this is out of a BCBC report on
                            the OBPS. They’re saying that, this year, absent this new system in
                            place, we’ll have about a $27.83 a tonne disadvantage in comparison to
                            California and Quebec. It actually goes up when you can compare it with
                            electricity only in certain jurisdictions in North America.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I guess I say — in framing up the concern, I guess, with the
                            discussions and the length of time — that that competitiveness each year
                            starts to tip, especially against American jurisdictions, especially
                            with the new IRA act down in the U.S.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Next year, when the minister has indicated the new system will be
                            in place in time for the start of the fiscal, carbon tax will be $80 a
                            tonne. It will have gone from $65 to $80. So the march to $170 is going
                            to be upon us very quickly and very fast.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>That means big dollars involved as well. So that’s why I think
                            there’s this worry about transparency out there. If you use LNG alone,
                            just on their first phase, with $170 carbon tax and with the new
                            suggested parameters…. Both the Minister of Environment and the Minister
                            of Finance have indicated that if you meet your benchmark, you pay zero.
                            That’s about $680 million a year just to that one project of carbon tax
                            that’s waived. It’s about $27 billion over the 40-year span of that
                            project.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>It starts to be very big, big dollars when you’re talking
                            industry. That’s why I think there’s a mood within industry to make sure
                            that it’s being dealt with properly because of the competitive side. But
                            there’s also a mood on the environmental organization side to make sure
                            that things are being done to the standard that will see actual
                            meaningful improvement to emission profiles.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Will recognized environmental groups also be a part of those same
                            tables that industry is sitting at, or will they not be included in the
                            development of the OBPS?</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>Within Bill 10, or, I guess, by extension, flowing over to the
                            budgets…. Under the current system, there has always been a dollar
                            figure somewhat attached to the expected dollars associated with the
                            carbon tax offset for industry. Is there anything in Bill 10 that would
                            cap the dollars available for industry under the new OBP system, or will
                            it just be if you meet the standard, you qualify, and the dollar figure
                            is somewhat irrelevant?</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>As I say, based on current emission profiles, at $170 a tonne, it
                            will be somewhere in the neighbourhood of $8 billion or $10 billion of
                            carbon tax technically being collected in British Columbia. But under
                            OBPS, that’s obviously going to remove a large portion of those
                            dollars.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Is there a cap? Is it going to be capped at $5 billion, $4
                            billion, that could be returned back to industry, or is it just if
                            industry qualifies, they qualify, and the dollar figure is somewhat
                            irrelevant in that equation?</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>The point of the OBPS is to put a price on pollution. If industry
                            meets and continues to meet the standards, then the OBPS has met its
                            objectives, because the goal is to lower emissions.</dialogue>

                            piece of information that the federal government is collecting…. The
                            provincial government has access to that information and can start
                            trying to link it in with homeowner grants and other things to do with

                            anything in…? I don’t see it in Bill 10. There’s nothing in Bill 10 that

                            OIC that doesn’t currently exist in terms of the removal of the

                            the sections here in the papers. I see the minister and her staff doing
                            the same, so that’s good. It keeps us on equal footing, I
                            think.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>So 63 — this is the renters tax credit section. A few questions in
                            this area. In 8.31, there’s the adjusted income, which, it says: “In
                            relation to an eligible individual for a taxation year, means the total
                            of all amounts each of which would be the income for the year of the
                            individual or the individual’s cohabitating spouse or common-law partner
                            if, in computing that income….”</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I take this to mean, then, that the threshold to qualify for the
                            renters rebate is a household income. So it’s a combined income. Can the
                            minister refresh all of our memories in terms of what those thresholds
                            are and if it is indeed an actual household income versus an
                            individual’s income?</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>Households are combined, just so that the member knows. The credit
                            begins up to $60,000 of the combined household. You get the full credit
                            between $60,000 to $80,000. Then the credit begins to phase
                            out.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>Thank you. So this would be, well, first off, trust-based, I
                            guess. So as people file their federal income tax, if they check off
                            “common law”, they’re bound by those. If they’re just dating but haven’t
                            really declared themselves common-law, if they’re just roommates, does
                            that count as…? If I and my girlfriend — to my wife at home, I don’t
                            have a girlfriend; this is just an example — declare ourselves common
                            law, we would only qualify for the $400. Myself and my roommate don’t,
                            and we would qualify for $800. Is that what the minister is saying, if
                            we were under $60,000 each in income?</dialogue>
                    </speech>

                        <member tocID="tt4190">Hon. K. Conroy</member>
                        <dialogue>Yeah, the member is right. If he and his fictitious girlfriend
                            just live together, not as common-law, they would both qualify if they
                            were under that $60,000 marker. If three students live together, they
                            would each qualify. As long as their income is under the $60,000, they
                            would qualify for the full amount — if they were just living as friends,
                            not as cohabiting.</dialogue>

                            landlord and one rent to be paid. So you could be renting with a friend
                            and have a combined income of $120,000 and get $800 back. If you’re
                            common-law, paying the same landlord on the same type of a unit and the
                            same rent, with a combined income of $120,000, you get zero. Am I

                        <dialogue>Yes. However, households are families, and there are economies of

                        <dialogue>Well, there are economies of scale, but a landlord is still the
                            landlord, and the rent paid is still the rent paid. As I said to my
                            daughter when she wanted to move out when she was 19, I’m not worried
                            about whether you have your rent. But if you’re with three roommates, a
                            landlord doesn’t say: “Well, thanks. You paid your quarter. I’m only
                            kicking the other three people out that didn’t pay.” They want 100
                            percent of the rent, regardless of which of the four may or may not be
                            able to pay that month. That’s how the system works.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Would it be, then, accurate that the intent and the design of this
                            is meant for low-income people that typically, by virtue of being
                            low-income, would only be able to afford lower-cost housing in the first
                            place?</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>Well, I get that, but at a $60,000 threshold before you start
                            having it scaled back and only a $20,000 window of income before it goes
                            to zero, in this day and age, it’s very much — especially household
                            income — geared to lower-income workers. This is understandable, but by
                            virtue of the threshold at $60,000, that would mean that they would only
                            be able to afford lower-cost housing options in the first
                            place.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I guess that leads to my question as to why the definition of
                            “‘rent,’ does not include the following payments,” includes “(d) a
                            payment in respect of a campsite, moorage or a manufactured home site as
                            defined in the Manufactured Home Park Tenancy Act.”</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>You could have somebody that has bought an older-model trailer but
                            still has to pay pad rent. They were able to afford the older-model
                            trailer; it’s in an older mobile home park. They’re low-income. They
                            have monthly pad rents. They qualify for everything because they’re a
                            renter at that point, yet under this bill, all of those people, which
                            would be a large portion of the lower-income people that this bill is
                            purporting to help, do not qualify.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Can the minister explain the rationale for not allowing pad rents
                            in mobile home parks if you’re meeting all the other requirements? It’s
                            not family-owned; it’s not a family member that’s renting you the pad
                            rent. Why the differentiation from someone living in a basement suite,
                            or someone living in a one-bedroom apartment, to somebody that has to
                            pay rent for a pad for their mobile home to be on?</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>I appreciate those updates from the minister. I appreciate the
                            arrangement to allow us to deal with emergency health this morning. I’m
                            really encouraging the minister to help us get through as much material
                            as possible. The hours are limited, and all of these topics matter to me
                            and to people in British Columbia.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Before we move to emergency health, I’d like to follow up on a
                            line of questioning that was actually started by the member for Saanich
                            North and the Islands. It began last month, in the estimates with the
                            Minister of Children and Family Development.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I have met, as have a number of people in our caucus, with a
                            number of people who are advocating on behalf of the Vancouver Island
                            eating disorder program. There is significant concern about the fact
                            that services have been impacted.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I went back and looked at the discussion that took place in
                            estimates. The fact of the matter is that there are not enough services.
                            People, particularly adults, who have an eating disorder need help. In
                            fact, what we’ve seen is adults on Vancouver Island who are facing
                            significant barriers to treatment and care. We know that would be the
                            case in many other places in B.C., and we simply need to do
                            better.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>When the debate took place…. I appreciate my colleague from the
                            Green Party raising these issues. When speaking to the Minister of
                            Children and Families, she responded: “There’s work going on to align
                            this particular clinic with other models in other health authorities.
                            We’re working with the Mental Health and Addictions Ministry, Health and
                            with Island Health to have a look at the future for the
                            clinic.”</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Can the minister tell me today exactly what work has been done?
                            What resources will be provided for people who are desperately in need
                            of help? They have been here to the Legislature. They have met with us
                            individually. Health, apparently, has a role to play in that. Is there
                            funding being provided to ensure that there are services and supports in
                            place, not just on Vancouver Island but across the province, for those
                            people with eating disorders?</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>I think the issue on Vancouver Island…. I will endeavour — on the
                            broader issue of eating disorders, I don’t want to take a lot of time.
                            This was an issue that I raised frequently as an opposition critic for
                            Health, and it has been raised back along a number of years, about the
                            adequacy of overall services, but I won’t give a long discussion of that
                            everywhere.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>There’s an issue on Vancouver Island with respect to adult and
                            children’s mental health services. One is provided through the health
                            authority, and the other is provided through MCFD. Those two services —
                            it’s my expectation that they’ll be aligned. There have been new
                            resources going through the health authorities for adult mental health
                            services, and it’s my intention, my belief, that those will be
                            aligned.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I’ll provide more information not weeks from now but later today,
                            to the member, to be clear about where we are in that
                            process.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>Thank you to the minister. I would appreciate, certainly,
                            follow-up information. It is incredibly devastating to hear people’s
                            personal stories of distress and their inability to get the service that
                            they need. They want to go on and be able to live productive, healthier
                            lives, so we are deeply concerned about that.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I will look forward to a further update from the minister about
                            what’s being done on Vancouver Island. I’m very concerned about the fact
                            that multiple ministries are involved and it’s: “Okay, it’s over to
                            Health; it’s Mental Health. People just want the issue resolved on
                            Vancouver Island.”</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I’m going to ask my colleague to ask his question about emergency
                            health.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>Thanks to my colleague for the time.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I just want to say at the onset of this…. It’ll be a quick
                            question, but I do want to acknowledge the work that the minister and I
                            have done in my riding from Revelstoke to Kimberley. It’s been
                            successful, and hopefully this question will end up with success as
                            well.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>As the minister will know, Columbia River–Revelstoke is a tourism
                            community, by and large. I’m going to use the Columbia Valley as an
                            example of this. Our populations increase dramatically over the summer
                            from May to October. In the Columbia Valley, that population increase is
                            30,000 to 40,000 people through tourism.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Also, another issue…. That’s the first issue, which is not an
                            issue. We’re very grateful for it.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>But also, we’ve got Albertans who are coming and using our
                            emergency in Invermere, a little, tiny eight-bed hospital with amazing
                            docs, nurses and support staff. They’re coming across and using our
                            emergency because they triage at 12, 14 hours in Calgary, so they’re
                            coming to us.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Also, with the new decriminalization of opioids and other drugs,
                            we are expecting, as one policeman told me, the great trek west. We’re
                            going to see people coming. It’s legal in British Columbia now, so we’re
                            assuming that we’re going to see higher usages.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>A couple of things come out of that narration. We’re already
                            stretched in terms of our resources. I’m going to be talking to the
                            Public Safety Minister about this, as far as policing, but from a health
                            perspective, we have two cars in Invermere. They’re busy all the time,
                            as you will know. With the increase of population, with the increase of
                            drug usage, which we’re assuming, and the increase of Calgary people
                            coming into our hospitals, huge pressure is being put on our
                            resources.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>From May to October, does the minister have any idea or will the
                            minister provide any additional resources for these communities that I
                            represent through those busy times? We don’t have enough.</dialogue>

                        <member tocID="tx1377">Hon. A. Dix</member>
                        <dialogue>I’m not sure I agree with all the premises of the question. The
                            member will know that, especially in his constituency, we’ve made
                            significant investments in the ambulance service. We talked at length
                            about Revelstoke and Golden. Revelstoke, 24-7; Golden, 24-7; Invermere,
                            24-7; and Kimberley, 24-7. This is a change and an increase in services
                            that the member advocated for, that we’ve talked about on a number of
                            occasions and that have occurred. This really reflects the
                            transformation of the ambulance service both in the region and in the
                            province, in rural, remote communities.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>In addition, with the rural and remote framework, we added an
                            ambulance to the region, to provide additional supports. Obviously,
                            there are other communities. Field — I was talking to an ambulance
                            paramedic from Field last night, actually, at length on this question.
                            But I won’t take up too much of the time to talk about ambulance service
                            in Field. It’s an SOC, and we’re working through, now, the collective
                            agreement, the increase in service in communities such as
                            that.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>We see an increase in ambulance services and ambulance response.
                            We obviously monitor it through the years. The circumstances the member
                            is talking about are not new to this year. It is something that we will
                            obviously continue to monitor.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>He’s quite right that B.C…. There’s always a discussion about B.C.
                            and Alberta, that we care for a lot more Alberta patients in B.C. than
                            they care for B.C. patients in Alberta. That’s because of policy changes
                            they’ve made in the last number of years because of the challenges
                            facing their health care system. We’re ahead of them in most measures of
                            surgery and other things, and that means we provide more care to
                            Albertans than they provide to British Columbians. We’re not going to
                            respond in kind by limiting that care. We’re going to provide great care
                            when it comes.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I’ve heard the hon. member’s representation. He knows that we’re
                            very responsive when we hear from things in community, and we’ll clearly
                            be monitoring that this summer.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I’d also note that these increases in services, this increase in
                            permanent staff in the region is going to transform the Ambulance
                            Service and, we believe, will result in better service. I think the
                            result of the most recent collective agreement with CUPE Local 873, the
                            ambulance paramedics….</dialogue>
                        <timestamp>1125</timestamp>
                        <dialogue>It was supported by 96 percent of ambulance paramedics, which has
                            to be a remarkable thing. I know some ambulance paramedics, and
                            sometimes we don’t have an easy time agreeing on the dinner menu, so 96
                            percent demonstrates the success of the union and our management at
                            working together to resolve these very issues.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>These issues, the issues of communities like Revelstoke, like
                            Golden, like Kimberley, were clearly issues at the table that we worked
                            through. We’re going to continue to do so, and I appreciate the member’s
                            representation.</dialogue>

                        <member tocID="tx1387">S. Bond</member>
                        <dialogue>Thank you to my colleague for that question and his concern,
                            always, for his residents, the people he represents.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I want to spend a few minutes…. Thank you to representatives from
                            BCEHS who are here today. I think all of us agree that it’s a pretty
                            straightforward principle that if you dial 911, you should expect you’re
                            going to get some help in British Columbia.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Earlier this week there was a story that a father called an
                            ambulance for his daughter, who had suddenly lost her hearing and vision
                            and began sweating. I would imagine that most families would feel pretty
                            concerned about that. The father called 911, and he got a message the
                            first time, “Hang up and call again,” which he did. Ten minutes later,
                            he was passed through to a dispatcher. Even still, they had to take her
                            to the hospital themselves.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Does the minister agree that perhaps the first time someone calls
                            911, they should actually get an answer?</dialogue>
                    </speech>

                        <member tocID="tx1392">Hon. A. Dix</member>
                        <dialogue>When people call 911, of course, there are two processes. There’s
                            an E-Comm process, and then, if it’s for ambulance, they’ll ask you what
                            you need, and it’ll go to the ambulance process. Both require…. As the
                            member will know, there has been significant investment by the
                            government, in support of E-Comm in B.C., in the last while. There are
                            some issues there that are being resolved.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>There are also issues for BCEHS, I would say, just to look at the
                            dispatcher side that we’ve moved from in the last short period, in the
                            last year. This is higher, since we last were in estimates, from 248
                            dispatchers to 281. This is a critical issue, this issue of dispatch, to
                            be able to respond to people appropriately when they come and then
                            dispatch.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Obviously, every call that comes into the Ambulance Service is
                            triaged for the severity of need and the severity of response. That goes
                            without saying. I understand, and certainly, will review the issue. I
                            think the issue was in the newspaper, or a complaint was made around
                            this case, which I think involved someone from Langley. I may be
                            mistaken. Every time that happens, we obviously review that to ensure
                            that that doesn’t happen.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>There is occasionally a delay, because — even when you have
                            substantially increased the number of dispatchers — if, at some point, a
                            lot of phone calls come in, there may be some issues. So some advice may
                            go out to say, “This is what’s happening” or “Call us back,” and so on,
                            and you go into a priority queue.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>In any event, what we believe, anyway, is that substantial
                            investment was required in dispatch in the province. That’s why we’ve
                            provided that significant increase over time. Really, in the last few
                            years, the total is from 235 to 281, which is a substantial net increase
                            in dispatch.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Obviously, those dispatchers — and the member, I know, agrees with
                            this — do an exceptional job responding to people in a moment where, I
                            agree, they’re calling 911, and they need to hear a professional
                            response on the phone. Our ambulance dispatchers do an excellent job. We
                            feel we need more of them, and that’s why more of them have been
                            hired.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>Again, I want to thank the representatives that are here today for
                            the work that they do, and all of their members. It’s not about them.
                            It’s about a system that is under extraordinary pressure in British
                            Columbia. Whether it’s ambulances or it’s nurses, doctors and all of the
                            health care professionals, it takes an enormous toll.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I will just remind the minister that this person got a recorded
                            message. They believed they were having a health emergency of a
                            daughter. The message was: “If this is an emergency, please hang up and
                            dial 911 again.” I would assume that if you dial 911 in the first place,
                            you would be thinking that it is an emergency. I just want to remind the
                            minister that this particular family talked about what an absolutely
                            terrible experience it was.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I understand that additional resources have been added, but
                            there’s still work to be done. Let’s take a look, for example, at what
                            we have seen. On March 22, 2023, paramedics in this province responded
                            to 205 overdose calls. That is the single highest number that has ever
                            been recorded in a single day. The previous record was in January of
                            2022.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>My question to the minister: in light of the overdose incidents
                            that are increasing — we know that the numbers are absolutely horrific
                            and tragic — are there specific additional resources being provided to
                            ensure that front-line staff are able to take care of their own mental
                            health as well? We have increasing call numbers. The pressure on
                            paramedics in this province is extraordinary. That continues to climb.
                            Could the minister speak to us about what we’re doing to ensure that
                            front-line staff are being properly cared for?</dialogue>
                    </speech>

                        <member tocID="tx1405">Hon. A. Dix</member>
                        <dialogue>A few points. First of all, with respect to mental health supports
                            but also with respect to ambulance paramedics. Just for the record, I
                            agree with the member — and the overdose public health emergency is part
                            of it — that we’re also seeing, and we have seen, a very large increase
                            in what we call purple and red calls, the most serious calls that
                            ambulance paramedics receive, the ones they have to get to right
                            now.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>We’ve seen an increase across a range of conditions, including
                            mental health and addictions. That’s one of the significant ones but
                            also conditions such as heart attack and stroke.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Just to say that the number of full-time paramedics has increased
                            from 1,375 to 2,368 since I’ve been Minister of Health. That’s a 72
                            percent increase in full-time paramedics. The number of part-time
                            paramedics has increased by 87 percent. What we’re seeing — and that’s
                            significant, I think — is a major investment in, and a transformation
                            of, the service.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I wanted to note as well that we’ve added…. Some of this has been
                            through the recent collective agreement, ratified by ambulance
                            paramedics, which very much focused on these issues. The union wanted
                            to, as well. There have been substantial investments to the critical
                            incident stress management program with $5 million provided to that. A
                            joint committee was created in April ’22 to work through these issues.
                            We’ve seen an increase in supports and clinician referrals, of 69
                            percent since 2021, which demonstrates both the demand, as the member
                            notes, and the needs.</dialogue>
                        <timestamp>1135</timestamp>
                        <dialogue>We’re doing an evaluation of that program, which we’re expecting
                            shortly. We’ve added a director of mental health for the system, to
                            support our ambulance teams. We’ve added additional team members to the
                            critical incident stress management program. All of those issues — and
                            the work that we’ve done, together with our union — have made a
                            significant effect.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I’ll just say that in 2022, December ’22, it took approximately
                            one to two weeks for a referral to a clinician to be complete in the
                            service. As of March 31 of this year, the average wait time for a
                            referral request to be accepted by clinician is approximately one to
                            three days. So we went, in this period, demonstrating the priority and
                            the impact of that, from one to two weeks for a referral to one to three
                            days. This all reflects the strong commitment of our leadership at
                            BCEHS.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I, again, want to introduce Leanne Heppell and Neil Lilley who
                            represent the leadership and really represent our extraordinary
                            paramedics around the province.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>But the commitment, especially, of CUPE Local 873 to support their
                            members as well…. You see the real tangible improvements that have been
                            made in terms of those supports needed. Because the work, as the member
                            rightly says, in the time of two public health emergencies has been
                            exceptional. The increase in the calls…. That means the response of
                            ambulance paramedics has increased commensurate with the massive
                            increase in resources.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>Under the recruitment strategy that was announced, were there
                            specific targets put in place for 2022-23, ’23-24 in terms of
                            paramedics, dispatchers, all of the personnel that are covered under
                            that recruitment strategy? Can the minister tell me: were there targets
                            put in place? And can he provide me with an update on current
                            vacancies?</dialogue>

                        <member tocID="tx1417">Hon. A. Dix</member>
                        <dialogue>I’ll just go through some of the information for the hon. member.
                            I want to make the point that this has been an exceptional period of
                            growth for ambulance paramedics.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>There are two issues, I would argue. One is to ensure, obviously,
                            for the public, that they received that response that we all know. Two,
                            that we support ambulance paramedics. The major issue has not been
                            recruitment, although there’s always a challenge in recruitment. But you
                            can see what we’ve done.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>We’ve added, in 2021, 539 permanent regular full-time paramedic
                            positions and 71 irregular full-time positions. In November ’22, we
                            added 222 permanent new full-time positions. If you look at the actual
                            hours worked, the productive hours increased by 10 percent over time.
                            This is an important question — increased by 41 percent the number of
                            hours prepared by ambulance paramedics. The actual hours — that’s not
                            all this discussion of positions and everything else — worked by
                            dispatchers increased by 13.7 percent, and overtime increase by 15.9
                            percent.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>So we have a dramatic effort being made to increase the service.
                            You see the success of that recruitment, and we’re taking extraordinary
                            steps to continue that.</dialogue>
                        <timestamp>1140</timestamp>
                        <dialogue>I think the one thing that I would say, and I was just looking at
                            the number here, is the one area where we…. Why it links to the previous
                            question is what we have seen, as well, is a significant increase in
                            ambulance paramedics off work in the last number of years. It’s what
                            drives the commitment to support mental health services in that
                            respect.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>When someone is off work, obviously that both puts pressure on
                            overtime but also takes away some of the impact of the very significant
                            increases in the numbers of ambulance paramedics.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I’ll just give the member a sense of this for the last three
                            years. We have, on leave full-time, 219 paramedics on leave in 2021, 270
                            on leave in 2022 and 292 on leave in 2023. So the issue that we have in
                            the ambulance service and why we are so committed with the union to work
                            on supports that allow people to deal with critical incidents and also
                            come back to work is because it has a real impact on the health human
                            resources in the ambulance service as well.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>So you see the ambition — the increases at the Justice Institute,
                            the increases in our partnerships with other paramedic training
                            institutes in the province. All of that is having success, but we have
                            to continue to add, especially on the mental health side, to increase
                            significantly and continue to have strong supports so ambulance
                            paramedics who are full-time but off work get back to work.</dialogue>

                        <member tocID="tx1427">S. Bond</member>
                        <dialogue>Thank you to the minister. I’m a bit concerned about time here. I
                            will lay out several questions and perhaps the minister can come back
                            after the break and answer them for me.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I appreciate the update on the work that has been done, but it’s
                            clear there’s more work to be done. I am deeply concerned about, as I
                            have expressed continuously through the last four days now, the sense of
                            moral distress that people in the health care system are feeling about
                            not being able to actually manage the jobs that they care about and that
                            they are called to do.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I want to raise this point. Certainly, adding additional
                            paramedics are one thing, but as importantly is how many additional cars
                            are on the road. I’m wondering if the minister can provide what regions
                            and stations have net new cars and shifts been added to. That actually
                            is as important as having additional paramedics.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I want to also…. I’ll just lay these questions out before Mr.
                            Chair hands the note over.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>We also, yesterday…. I want to, obviously, make sure the context
                            is correct. The Ambulance Paramedics and Dispatchers of B.C. have been
                            clear that they’ve appreciated the investments that have been made, but
                            yesterday they made several, what I think are, very important and
                            relevant points that need to be pursued. One of them is the fact that
                            hey talked about recruitment and actually getting people on the ground.
                            Their spokesperson said: “Despite recruitment efforts that have drawn
                            more applicants, there are bottlenecks in training and hiring. A lot of
                            the delay is in the human resources system within BCEHS.”</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I’d like the minister to respond to that at some point, about what
                            we’re doing to. It’s great if we can recruit more people. The most
                            important thing is to train them and get them out into the
                            system.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>The other issue that was raised, and I certainly continue to hear
                            this across the province…. Progress, yes, but we want to make sure that
                            we are reducing the delay in ambulance response times, especially in
                            rural and remote communities. The minister and I have probably not often
                            been in the position of having to dial 911. But I can assure you that
                            the feeling of helplessness and frustration when there is not an
                            appropriate response time….</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>The concern that was expressed was the need for a review in terms
                            of how many resources are needed in larger centres, because the point
                            that was made is that resources are being taken from surrounding smaller
                            communities. The example that was used was Victoria. Staff is being
                            pulled in from places like Sooke, because we need more ambulances just
                            to meet the demand and the pressures that have built up over the
                            years.</dialogue>
                        <timestamp>1145</timestamp>
                        <dialogue>Again, what that does is put other communities at risk, when we’re
                            madly trying to staff up in larger urban centres. Is the minister
                            prepared to agree to a review that actually looks at how resources are
                            deployed and what happens when we have to pull those resources out of
                            smaller communities? I’m wondering if he could respond to
                            that.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Maybe that review is underway, but it certainly, as I understand
                            it, hasn’t been completed, or we’re not even sure what the schedule is
                            and if the report would be released to the public. I think those are
                            critically important questions as we try to sort out how we are going to
                            ensure that people have appropriate response times.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>This is the statement that concerned me. He says: “I think back to
                            what happened during the heat dome in British Columbia, where over 600
                            frail elderly British Columbians died.” One of the concerns…. You can
                            imagine how personnel feel when they can’t get there, when ambulances
                            were simply overwhelmed and couldn’t respond.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I remember the story of the family that was desperate for help,
                            and what did they do? They drove their loved one to the driveway of a
                            fire hall, just trying to find somebody who would help them. That person
                            died in the driveway of the fire hall.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>So here’s the quote: “It’s not all wonderful as described and
                            we’re seeing significant delays, and unless we get a handle on this,
                            we’ll keep seeing those delays.” Here’s the concern as we get into the
                            busy season.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I’m wondering if the minister and EHS representatives can talk
                            about what we are doing to be prepared for the busy season. We’ve
                            already seen the highest number of overdose calls on a single day. That
                            was in March. I’m assuming the busy season refers to wildfire, heat
                            domes and all of the things that extreme weather relates to. So if we’re
                            not managing now — not my words but the words of the representative from
                            paramedics and dispatchers — are we ready for the busy
                            season?</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>I’m going to say a few words, I think brief. Is that brief or
                            brie?</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Thank you to the member for the question. I’ll just make a number
                            of points. During the COVID-19 pandemic, which surely was the busy
                            season…. In fact, I think the experience of ambulance paramedics is that
                            the busy season is pretty much 365 days a year, without exception, and
                            since I get information on ambulance calls every day, I can attest to
                            the fact that it’s busy.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I’ll just make a couple of points. In rural response times, rural
                            median response times have gone down by 48 seconds for purple calls
                            since 2018, which is, I would say, a real achievement of the ambulance
                            service, and that’s been a priority of ours. We put in, on April 20,
                            2021, a rural and remote framework to improve services because we knew
                            we had to get to people, particularly in times of COVID-19. Or should I
                            say 2020, the times of COVID-19, to get people to the hospital more
                            quickly.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>We’ve added significantly to cars on the ground. We’ve added
                            significantly to airplanes. We’re about to significantly improve
                            helicopter service, air ambulance helicopter service in the province.
                            We’ve added 125 ground ambulances. We’ll be happy to provide more
                            information on that. So more ambulance paramedics, more dispatchers,
                            more cars, more airplanes, more helicopters.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>In some areas, especially on the most severe calls, we’ve done
                            exceptionally well. I would note that the number of the most severe
                            calls, which I referred to earlier, is increasing. The number of those
                            purple calls that I referred to, the number of them that we face across
                            the province in every year, has increased in five years, in a time of
                            population growth of approximately 6 percent, by about 26
                            percent.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>That indicates that when you’re talking about reducing response
                            times on purple calls in the context of the number of calls going up by
                            26 percent, that is heroic work by ambulance paramedics.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I want to thank, on behalf of the people of the province, the
                            chair of the board, Jim Chu; Leanne Heppell; who became our chief

                            Lilley; and the whole team, every ambulance paramedic, every dispatcher
                            in the province. I know that all members of the House, regardless of
                            what side of the House they’re on, agree and appreciate…. Our gratitude

                        <dialogue>And with that, I move that the House rise and report progress and

                        <dialogue>Yes. I look forward to the dialogue and the questions from the
                            members opposite. I want to welcome my great team at Attorney General.
                            I’m going to read all their names out, and I want to thank them for
                            their participation and all their hard work.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>We have Barbara Carmichael, the Deputy Attorney General; Tracy

                        <dialogue>Thanks to the minister and the officials accompanying her and
                            assisting her. Just an administrative matter. For the balance of the
                            morning I’ll pose some questions. Our colleague from the Green Party
                            will, for scheduling reasons, resume at one o’clock. I’m not certain
                            what areas he wishes to canvass over the time that we’ve agreed to
                            allocate to him.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I’ll be concentrating on some areas involving — surprise, surprise
                            — public safety and then move from there. I expect that will take us
                            through the balance of the day, but we’ll see how that goes.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>We’ll start with a general question to try and contextualize the
                            conversation we’re going to have. In the Attorney’s mind, recognizing
                            that she has assumed this position relatively recently, but she’s now
                            the spokesperson for the government on these important matters: is B.C.
                            a safer place to live today than it was five or six years
                            ago?</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>I want to thank the member for this very important question. We
                            often talk about it quite a bit, in the House and certainly
                            politically.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I have to say that communities across the country have been
                            dealing with specific challenges when it comes to safety. Those
                            challenges we are responding to in different ways. That is in our safer
                            communities action plan, which has targeted responses to the challenges
                            with safety that communities are coming to us with.</dialogue>
                    </speech>
                    <speech>
                        <member tocID="tz641">M. de Jong</member>
                        <dialogue>Well, to be fair, challenges in this area have existed. They have
                            existed prior to this Attorney General taking her position, prior to
                            this government assuming office, and will undoubtedly continue to exist
                            in the future.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>My question was more specific than that, though. Because I have
                            found, over the time that I have spent in this place and elsewhere, that
                            we’re not likely to have any success addressing a problem if we don’t
                            acknowledge that a problem exists.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>So I’ll try it again. On a comparative basis with the Attorney
                            General, who has some very specific responsibilities around the criminal
                            justice system and the administration of justice: to her mind, is
                            British Columbia a safer place to live in today than it was five or six
                            years ago?</dialogue>
                    </speech>
                    <speech>
                        <member tocID="tz645">Hon. N. Sharma</member>
                        <dialogue>Again, I think the question calls for a very subjective answer. I
                            base my perception on policy directives, and so does everybody in the
                            ministry, based on facts and evidence that we see in communities. We’ve
                            been very public, and I certainly have been, on our focus on repeat
                            violent offenders and the impacts of COVID specifically on communities
                            related to that.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>So to that regard, I think the member has heard me very often talk
                            about how we think we need better tools in our justice system to address
                            repeat violent offenders. And then our safer communities action plan is
                            about responding to those impacts of COVID.</dialogue>
                    </speech>
                    <speech>
                        <member tocID="tz648">M. de Jong</member>
                        <dialogue>That was somewhat helpful. In assessing the question of public
                            safety, which I presume the Attorney would agree is a legitimate
                            exercise for us to engage in, in this place and in this committee and
                            during these estimates, what variables would the Attorney direct us to,
                            to render an opinion?</dialogue>
                        <timestamp>1130</timestamp>
                    </speech>
                    <speech>
                        <member tocID="tz651">Hon. N. Sharma</member>
                        <dialogue>Thanks for the question. It’s actually a very broad question. I’m
                            going to start by saying that obviously, my role, as the member knows,
                            in public safety is as Attorney General, so any questions related to the
                            broader Ministry of Public Safety and the choices made for that would be
                            obviously up to Minister Farnworth. But what I can tell you is with the
                            question about what variables we consider with respect to the Attorney
                            General’s office. Of course, that’s varied and very comprehensive and
                            depending on the issue.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>First, I would say we have a team of experts within our ministry
                            that have a level of expertise in their area, that are constantly
                            engaging and communicating with front-line workers, assessing programs
                            that are in place. We have, obviously, our independent advisers, like
                            the B.C. Prosecution Service.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Our role is to respond to the needs of the justice system to do
                            the work that it needs to do — for example, making investments for one
                            of the largest calls for Crown counsel resources, so hiring 40 new Crown
                            counsel was a response to some of the needs. Standing up the repeat
                            violent offenders initiative was also a response.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>We rely on many actors, some of them independent, some of them
                            internal to the ministry, and many factors. I’m sure we will go into
                            details as we get into different programs and I’ll be able to provide a
                            more specific answer.</dialogue>
                    </speech>
                    <speech>
                        <member tocID="tz656">M. de Jong</member>
                        <dialogue>Well I’m going to invite the Attorney to provide a little more
                            specific answer now. Whilst I understand that she occupies a role, and a
                            very important one, but not a singular role. She mentioned her
                            colleagues and the fact that these matters cross ministerial lines. In
                            the case of the criminal justice system, it is a central and
                            determinative role.</dialogue>
                        <timestamp>1135</timestamp>
                        <dialogue>I’m trying to ascertain the degree to which the Attorney, as the
                            spokesperson for the government, believes there is a problem. So I can
                            say to the committee…. And the Attorney is correct that we’ve had these
                            conversations in the House in another context that doesn’t lend itself
                            well to a kind of discussion that we can have here.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I can say, or my colleague can say, that we have a criminal
                            justice, public safety, criminal violence problem, but our views on that
                            matter are far less relevant than the Attorney’s. So in determining
                            whether or not there is an issue…. And she has mentioned peripherally
                            some of the things that she and the government believe they could or
                            should do. I first need to know or would like to know, and the committee
                            would like to know, the degree to which she believes there is a problem
                            and on what basis she comes to that conclusion. Surely there
                            are….</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>If there is a subjective element to this…. But surely it is based
                            in part on actual data. Surely the ministry and, by extension, the
                            minister, in determining whether there is a problem or not, look to
                            certain variables as evidence and would cite that data as either
                            supportive of the proposition that the problem is not as great as the
                            opposition alleges, or it is, in fact….</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>What are those variables? In the areas for which the ministry and
                            the minister have responsibility, the criminal justice system, surely
                            there are indicators and variables that she looks at to determine
                            whether or not and the extent to which we have a problem. What are
                            they?</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>I just would like to ask for clarification from the member. I
                            think it would be helpful if we were narrowing. I’ve spoken earlier
                            about how we’ve very publicly — and again, in this committee — talked
                            about what we’re concerned about with repeat violent offenders. So I’m
                            happy to provide the basis for that, for the reasons that we’re taking
                            action on that or calling for reform.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I just want clarity of what the member is asking — if he could
                            narrow it a little bit.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>I don’t mean to be argumentative, but the minister has now been
                            around this place long enough to know what I am seeking.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I could make a speech for 15 minutes, time and time again, making
                            my allegations. I am far more interested to know whether the Attorney,
                            as the spokesperson for the government in this case, believes we have a
                            public safety issue and, if she does, on what basis she comes to that
                            conclusion. It is for her to say, not me. It is for her to say whether
                            or not we have a public safety issue and point to the areas that
                            convince her that is so — and to put that on the record.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>Thanks for the question that the member had. Of course I’m
                            concerned about crime. I think every time we hear about violent offences
                            in the news…. Of course that’s of concern to me, as Attorney General. We
                            have done quite a bit of work to fill the groundwork and to figure out
                            what policy changes we need to make to address that.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>To the member’s point about how I use to guide what solutions….
                            I’m sure the member knows about the LePard-Butler report. It went out
                            there and really examined the holistic approach to what’s needed to
                            address crime, specifically the violent offender.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>My piece of it, as Attorney General — I can speak to that; I can’t
                            speak to the other ministries that were involved in the other part of it
                            — is to make sure that the justice system has the tools that it needs to
                            respond to the types of crime we’re seeing. That, as I think the member
                            has heard me say many times, led us to ask for reform to the bail
                            system. It led us to stand up the repeat offenders intervention
                            initiative, which is focused on the justice system better circling
                            around repeat violent offenders, and a number of other initiatives held
                            by other ministries that are part of it. That’s under our safer
                            communities action plan.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>All right. Well, we’re making a little bit of progress
                            here.</dialogue>
                        <timestamp>1145</timestamp>
                        <dialogue>I’d like to be more specific. The Attorney, in her answer and in
                            her previous answer, as well, referred to challenges that communities
                            are facing and concerned about. She has indicated that she shares
                            concerns about those challenges.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>I’d like her to be more specific about what she sees those
                            challenges to be and whether they have gotten worse. I think those are
                            legitimate questions to pose to the person in charge, the justice
                            minister for the province. Incidents of violent criminal activity. Is it
                            the Attorney’s view that that situation has gotten worse over the course
                            of the last five or six years? Let’s start there.</dialogue>

                        <dialogue>I think I’ve been clear by saying that I do have concerns about
                            very specific types of criminal acts. I think our government has been
                            clear about our concerns, and that’s why they’ve informed our
                            actions.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Now, the reason that we’ve come to that is…. We’ve worked with
                            urban mayors. We worked with experts like LePard-Butler. We take advice
                            from the experts and the independent ones in our justice system. Again,
                            my job as Attorney General is to make sure that the justice system has
                            the tools that it needs to respond to the challenges, no matter what
                            they are.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>Communities across the country have seen the impacts of COVID.
                            It’s not uncommon to hear about acts, whether it’s transit in Toronto
                            or…. When I met with the other Attorneys General and public safety
                            ministers across the country, when we went to Ottawa, they all raised
                            very specific concerns about the impacts of COVID and how that’s showing
                            up with people. I think it was bear spray in Manitoba. There are very
                            specific challenges that each community is facing.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>We respond by hearing and listening to what’s happening in
                            communities. What I’ve heard from mayors and councils and, certainly,
                            our part of the justice system side of that is…. It is a small group of
                            people that are causing the repeat offences. That’s why our programs are
                            designed to invest, at least on the justice system side, and to bolster
                            the resources — to address that but also to call upon the federal
                            government for better tools.</dialogue>
                        <dialogue>With that, I move that the committee rise, report progress and ask
                            leave to sit again.</dialogue>
