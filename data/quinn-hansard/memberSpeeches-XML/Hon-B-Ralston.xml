         <p>I wish to introduce some guests joining us in the gallery today: my chief of staff, Krystal Smith, and her family. Her sister and brother-in-law Karla and Jim Leask own GeoTility, a geothermal company based in Kelowna. It does business across North America, including some B.C. schools and, most recently, the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art in California.</p>
         <p>Their children are here as well: Jimmy Leask, who works in sales at GeoTility, and Meagan Leask, who works at Allnorth Consultants as a project manager and has worked on projects at Highland Valley Copper and New Afton. They all live in Kelowna.</p>
         <p>Would the House please join me in making them very welcome.</p>
