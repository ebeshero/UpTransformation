         <p>Take Our Kids to Work Day is a great opportunity for students to get some experience seeing what a work environment is like, and it’s also a great chance for parents and intergenerational connections. Joining us in the House today are several grade 9 students and their parents and caregivers who happen to work for the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. They’re here for Take Our Kids to Work Day.</p>
         <p>Joining us are Caleb Jonker, Jennifer Jonker, Erin McIntosh, Meara McIntosh, Eloise Burns, Sharilynn Wardrop, Faye Quin, Melissa Quin, Jillian Burton, Robert Tones, Islay Mei Gordon and Alicen Chow.</p>
         <p>I hope members here will join me in making them all feel very welcome today.</p>
