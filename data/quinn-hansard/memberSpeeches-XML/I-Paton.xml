         <p>Today I’d like to welcome my dear wife, Pam. Some call her the de facto MLA for Delta South, but she does a great job backing me up and looking after our livestock on our farm when I’m not there.</p>
         <p>She’s here today with our good friends Scott and Michele Harris from Tsawwassen. Scott has recently retired as a famous nursery owner in Ladner called Harris Nurseryland.</p>
         <p>Would everybody please welcome my wife, Pam, and my guests, Scott and Michele.</p>
