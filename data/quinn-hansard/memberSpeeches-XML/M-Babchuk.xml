         <p>We’ve had members stand up in this chamber and talk about hockey, football and other sports, but it’s my privilege to stand up today and recognize four B.C. men that have taken top honours at the national Canadian Firefighters Curling Championship.</p>
         <p>The B.C. rink, skipped by Dean Thulin and backed up by third Ken Dawson, both of whom are from Campbell River, were teamed with Summerland’s Rob Robinson and Kevin Maxwell from Victoria. This foursome, after winning the provincial championship, headed to Prince Edward Island’s capital of Charlottetown to compete from March 24 to April 1.</p>
         <p>The rink went through the round robin with a 7-2 record, losing only to both northern Ontario and southern Ontario. They beat Alberta in the semifinal and then ended up facing northern Ontario again in the final game, where they prevailed, with a score of 8-6, to bring the gold medal to British Columbia.</p>
         <p>Next year’s Canadian Firefighting Curling Hydrant Championship will be in Moosomin, Saskatchewan, where I’m looking forward to watching team B.C. defend their title.</p>
         <p>Would this House please join me in congratulating Dean Thulin, who is an auxiliary firefighter from Fire Hall No. 2 in Campbell River; Ken Dawson, retired firefighter from Campbell River Hall No. 1; Rob Robinson, who is currently the chief of the Summerland Fire Department; and Kevin Maxwell, who is a firefighter with the department of defence at CFB Esquimalt, for the winning of their gold medal championship and thank them for representing British Columbia so well.</p>
