         <p>I have two guests in the gallery today, UVic students who took up my invitation, when I was in Dr. Andrew Wender’s class, to come and shadow me for the day.</p>
         <p>Eakam Dhillon is currently completing a degree in history, which made me very excited, and minoring in political science. Her interest includes soccer and volunteering at Punjabi school to help younger generations read, write and speak their mother tongue.</p>
         <p>Jaxson Halychuk grew up in Port Alberni and moved to Victoria in 2021 to go to UVic, where he is currently pursuing a bachelor of commerce. He did take a history course as well. His interests include running, hiking, playing rugby and computer software and technology. He’s looking to pursue a career in government.</p>
         <p>Would the House please make Eakam and Jaxson most welcome.</p>
