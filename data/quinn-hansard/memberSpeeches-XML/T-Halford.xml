         <p>Today in the gallery is somebody very familiar to us, Dr Julian Somers, a world-renowned clin­ical psychologist and professor of health sciences at Simon Fraser University. His work, of course, addresses social policies, clinical practices to aim to reduce homelessness and crime involving people who are struggling with addiction. He’s also here to participate in the Enough Is Enough rally with his son Nicholas.</p>
         <p>Now, Nicholas, a young man who is here to support his dad, wants to demonstrate that young voters want to see more action. He is a UBC urban forestry student and will be documenting the rally in order to spread the Enough Is Enough message far and wide across this province.</p>
         <p>I ask the House to please make them both welcome.</p>
