         <p>As most people know, every time I have an opportunity to stand up in this House and brag about the amazing district of Tumbler Ridge, I think it’s a great opportunity to do so again.</p>
         <p>Today the district of Tumbler Ridge has won the Canadian rights to be known now as SledTown ShowDown winners, as the best place to be in Canada to go snowmobiling. So people like myself and others…. I invite you up to that region to come and enjoy the most beautiful part of the province, I would say, up in the Tumbler Ridge area.</p>
         <p>With that, it’s my pleasure to welcome to the House today…. We have Darryl Krakowka, the mayor of Tumbler Ridge, who is with us today; his executive assistant, Karen Curry; and the executive director for the Tumbler Ridge Museum, who is also here today, Zena Conlin.</p>
         <p>I want the House to welcome them and thank the ministers who have agreed to meet with them today. Please welcome them to the House.</p>
