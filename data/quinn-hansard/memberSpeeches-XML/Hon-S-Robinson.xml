         <p>Joining us in the House today are three guests from UBC’s Political Science Student Association. James LaRose is the outgoing president, while Anouska Gautam and Nicole Mendoza are the incoming co-presidents. It’s always a pleasure to see students take on leadership roles to serve their community, and I thank them for their hard work.</p>
         <p>Would the House please join me in welcoming them here.</p>
