         <p>What happens to wildlife that inhabited a forested area that’s about to be clearcut logged? Well, here’s my observations, after more than 50 years as an outdoorsman. For any of the 81 species that den or nest in tree cavities, they are often killed in the process as they take shelter in those cavities, an environment that they deem safe. Many species reside in ground cavities and are crushed.</p>
         <p>For birds and fur-bearers that flee the area into adjacent forest cover, they are faced with new challenges. Most species are territorial, protecting their food source and their habitat with their life. A fight to the death is not uncommon.</p>
         <p>For species that flee into adjacent areas previously clearcut, they become susceptible to starvation and exposure due to lack of habitat. Suitable habitat can take more than a century of growth before it once again supports these species.</p>
         <p>The Migratory Birds Convention Act, a 100-year-old treaty between Canada, the United States and Mexico, prohibits disturbing any bird nests from May until August inclusive in British Columbia. Yet according to a study published in 2014, an estimated 400,000 bird nests are destroyed during this period each year from clearcutting. Millions of hectares of forest have been clearcut in British Columbia in the past 50 years.</p>
         <p>Raptors such as owls, goshawks and eagles use stick nests, located near the tops of mature trees. It’s an offence under B.C.’s Wildlife Act to destroy stick nests at any time, yet thousands of these nests have disappeared.</p>
         <p>To add insult to injury, once an area is clearcut, glyphosate is often used to kill the deciduous and broadleaf growth, a critical food source for most insects and wildlife.</p>
         <p>Wildlife displaced from clearcut logging stands little to no chance of survival. No wonder B.C.’s wildlife populations have plummeted.</p>
