                <p>Our text is <title level="a">Typopictoromania,</title> an epic fragment that was
                    to have been part of a much longer poem. It is epic like Dryden, satirical like
                    Pope, critical like Blake; the fragment reveals the beginnings of a poem that
                    was to use a grand yet cartoonish battle, one between the types of Caslon’s
                    print house and the brushes of Boydell’s Shakespeare Gallery, as an opportunity
                    to ridicule the abuse and abasement of poetic language during the revolutionary
                    period in England. While the poem was never finished, what has survived—a
                    preface, proposition, an invocation, a first canto, part of a second, and a few
                    random fragments, together totalling close to five hundred lines of poetry—are
                    both aesthetically and historically relevant to those interested in the early
                    romanticism of the revolutionary period. While Thelwall claims that he initially
                    intended to write a complete poem, its unfinished nature puts it in the same
                    historical camp as Keats’ <title level="m">Hyperion</title> and Coleridge’s
                        <title level="a">Kubla Khan</title>, texts that are paradoxically whole in
                    their incompleteness. Furthermore, the poem is of particular import for Thelwall
                    scholars; appearing in both <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title> of 1793 and
                    in the later Derby Manuscript, the poem bookends Thelwall’s career. The two
                    copies differ in a great many minor respects, particularly in punctuation, but a
                    significant amount of major variations, where the later Thelwall has rewritten
                    entire lines, are also present; a thorough study of the differences may be
                    valuable for scholars interested in the development from the younger to older
                    Thelwall. Thus, our task is to present a complete and accessible reading copy of
                    the poem, showing a preference to the most recent and hitherto unpublished
                    version (the Derby Manuscript) and including all important variations in
                    editorial notes and additional yet important material in appendices.
                    Furthermore, our TEI coding will ensure that scholars have access to all
                    variations between the texts for the sake of comparison.</p>

                                    Lillo and first performed in 1731. It is a tragedy that centres
                                    around the middle class; Barnwell, an apprentice, becomes
                                    involved with a prostitute, and then steals from, and eventually
                                    murders, his master. Although the prostitute in the play is not
                                    named Betty, Betty Careless was a well-known prostitute of the
                                    18th century. For more information, see the British Museum
