                <p>Our text is <title level="a">Typopictoromania,</title> an epic fragment that was
                    to have been part of a much longer poem. It is epic like Dryden, satirical like
                    Pope, critical like Blake; the fragment reveals the beginnings of a poem that
                    was to use a grand yet cartoonish battle, one between the types of Caslon’s
                    print house and the brushes of Boydell’s Shakespeare Gallery, as an opportunity
                    to ridicule the abuse and abasement of poetic language during the revolutionary
                    period in England. While the poem was never finished, what has survived—a
                    preface, proposition, an invocation, a first canto, part of a second, and a few
                    random fragments, together totalling close to five hundred lines of poetry—are
                    both aesthetically and historically relevant to those interested in the early
                    romanticism of the revolutionary period. While Thelwall claims that he initially
                    intended to write a complete poem, its unfinished nature puts it in the same
                    historical camp as Keats’ <title level="m">Hyperion</title> and Coleridge’s
                        <title level="a">Kubla Khan</title>, texts that are paradoxically whole in
                    their incompleteness. Furthermore, the poem is of particular import for Thelwall
                    scholars; appearing in both <title level="m">The Peripatetic</title> of 1793 and
                    in the later Derby Manuscript, the poem bookends Thelwall’s career. The two
                    copies differ in a great many minor respects, particularly in punctuation, but a
                    significant amount of major variations, where the later Thelwall has rewritten
                    entire lines, are also present; a thorough study of the differences may be
                    valuable for scholars interested in the development from the younger to older
                    Thelwall. Thus, our task is to present a complete and accessible reading copy of
                    the poem, showing a preference to the most recent and hitherto unpublished
                    version (the Derby Manuscript) and including all important variations in
                    editorial notes and additional yet important material in appendices.
                    Furthermore, our TEI coding will ensure that scholars have access to all
                    variations between the texts for the sake of comparison.</p>

                                    in 1786 he brought charges against him for impeachment, which
                                    were successful in 1787. Benedict Arnold (1741-1801) was an
                                    American military man during the war for American independence.
                                    In 1779, while he was the military governor of Philadelphia, he
                                    betrayed the cause and started providing information to the
                                    British side. His name became well-associated with
                                    betrayal.</note></lem>

                                        in Town and Country.—The latter part of this quotation
                                        formed the commencement of the second—the former the
                                        conclusion of the first Canto: the only one, indeed, which I
                                        had by any means finished, when I was induced by several

                                    of the <title level="m">P</title>, we can conclude that the

                                    Thelwall also includes an interjection, but it differs from that
