         This is the book of travels, which was compiled by <persName xml:id="recogito-086c8115-7e43-4f3f-ae4d-549dfc0f5410">Rabbi Benjamin</persName>, the

         The said <persName xml:id="recogito-59cd30b2-103c-42de-89dd-8d73c2ee61b5">Rabbi Benjamin</persName> set forth from <placeName xml:id="recogito-c53868dc-832a-4aa4-87dd-ca36406fb685">Tudela</placeName>, his native city, and
         passed through many remote countries, as is related in his book. In
         every place which he entered, he made a record of all that he saw, or
         was told of by trustworthy persons--matters not previously heard of in
         the land of <placeName xml:id="recogito-f67aebdb-5956-42da-91b0-4ba055b46aea">Sepharad</placeName><note n="1"/>. Also he mentions some of the sages and
         illustrious men residing in each place. He brought this book with him
         on his return to the country of <placeName xml:id="recogito-099d13ee-1299-4a5c-b2f7-f21a24b455d0">Castile</placeName>, in the year 4933 (C.E.
         1173)<note n="2"/>. The said <persName xml:id="recogito-992314b8-8925-4bb6-b5f0-b4d8f1a99025">Rabbi Benjamin</persName> is a wise and understanding man,
         learned in the Law and the Halacha, and wherever we have tested his
         statements we have found them accurate, true to fact and consistent;
         for he is a trustworthy man.

            they are all fettered in chains of iron, and guards are placed over each of their houses

            to seize him, but they answered, "We cannot see any man, although our ears hear him."
            Then the king and all his princes marvelled at his subtlety; but he said to the king "I

            shall no man prevail. Now our mandate is, that thou cease from these designs, or thou

slew him whilst he was asleep on his bed. Thus were his plans
frustrated. Then the king of <placeName xml:id="recogito-700fb975-26ea-4543-a053-7eaa2cc5b226"  >Persia</placeName> went forth against the Jews that

they overran the country of <placeName xml:id="recogito-a3b92cd2-086f-4ab5-a151-afa7bf539b65"  >Persia</placeName> with a large army and took the city
of <placeName xml:id="recogito-82564be4-36d4-422f-aaff-04a706b700b8"  >Rayy</placeName><note n="168"/>; they smote it with the edge of the sword, took all the
spoil thereof, and returned by way of the wilderness. Such an invasion
had not been known in the land of <placeName xml:id="recogito-67693f36-669d-4b06-b5db-d017958284f1"  >Persia</placeName> for many years. When the king
of <placeName xml:id="recogito-96b3dbfc-2fc3-482b-bfa4-16f2b786bb81"  >Persia</placeName> heard thereof his anger was kindled against them, and he
said, "Not in my days nor in the days of my fathers did an army sally
forth from this wilderness. Now I will go and cut off their name from
the earth." A proclamation was made throughout his Empire, and he
assembled all his armies; and he sought a guide who might show him the
way to their encampment. And a certain man said that he would show him
the way, as he was one of them. And the king promised that he would
enrich him if he did so. And the king asked him as to what provisions
they would require for the march through the wilderness.

<pb n="85"/>

And he replied, "Take with you bread and wine for fifteen days, for
you will find no sustenance by the way, till you have reached their
land." And they did so, and marched through the wilderness for fifteen
days, but they found nothing at all. And their food began to give out,
so that man and beast were dying of hunger and thirst. Then the king
called the guide, and said to him, "Where is your promise to us that
you would find our adversaries?" To which the other replied, "I have
mistaken the way." And the king was wroth, and commanded that his head
should be struck off. And the king further gave orders throughout the
camp that every man who had any food should divide it with his
neighbour. And they consumed everything they had including their
beasts. And after a further thirteen days' march they reached the
mountains of <placeName xml:id="recogito-165756fa-a455-4779-82fd-e0b4df1c91ab"  >Naisabur</placeName>, where Jews lived. They came there on the
Sabbath, and encamped in the gardens and plantations and by the
springs of water which are by the side of the river <placeName xml:id="recogito-aa562009-4fb9-42ca-b053-ed7d78f344a2"  >Gozan</placeName>. Now it was
the time of the ripening of the fruit, and they ate and consumed
everything. No man came forth to them, but on the mountains they saw
cities and many towers.

<pb n="86"/>

Then the king commanded two of his servants to go and inquire of the
people who lived in the mountains, and to cross the river either in
boats or by swimming. So they searched and found a large bridge, on
which there were three towers, but the gate of the bridge was locked.
And on the other side of the bridge was a great city. Then they
shouted in front of the bridge till a man came forth and asked them
what they wanted and who they were. But they did not understand him
till an interpreter came who understood their language. And when he
asked them, they said, "We are the servants of the king of <placeName xml:id="recogito-1c2b6e65-668a-4c40-9f21-282bfda81073"  >Persia</placeName>, and
we have come to ask who you are, and whom you serve." To which the
other replied: "We are Jews; we have no king and no Gentile prince,
but a Jewish prince rules over us." They then questioned him with
regard to the infidels, the sons of Ghuz of the Kofar-al-Turak, and he
answered: "Truly they are in league with us, and he who seeks to do
them harm seeks our harm." Then they went their way, and told the king
of <placeName xml:id="recogito-5e710f87-0c52-4dd7-abfb-f9a5cddc2f56"  >Persia</placeName>, who was much alarmed. And on a certain day the Jews asked
him to join combat with them, but he answered: "I am not come to fight
you, but the Kofar-al-Turak, my enemy, and if you fight against me I
will be avenged on you by killing all the Jews in my Empire; I know
that you are stronger than I am in this place, and my army has come
out of this great wilderness starving and athirst. Deal kindly with me
and do not fight against me, but leave me to engage with the
Kofar-al-Turak, my enemy, and sell me also the provisions which I
require for myself and my army."

<pb n="87"/>

The Jews then took counsel together, and resolved to propitiate the
king on account of the Jews who were in exile in his Empire. Then the
king entered their land with his army, and stayed there fifteen days.
And they showed him much honour, and also sent a dispatch to the
Kofar-al-Turak their allies, reporting the matter to them. Thereupon
the latter occupied the mountain passes in force with a large army
composed of all those who dwelt in that desert, and when the king of
<placeName xml:id="recogito-e2738f65-01aa-4385-ac7c-b8d67ea17054"  >Persia</placeName> went forth to fight with them, they placed themselves in battle
array against him. The Kofar-al-Turak army was victorious and slew
many of the Persian host, and the king of <placeName xml:id="recogito-fd1c3704-1234-436d-a91a-46dc39f5da7c"  >Persia</placeName> fled with only a few
followers to his own country<note n="169"/>.

Now a horseman, one of the servants of the king of <placeName xml:id="recogito-6bcbef7c-7051-4e87-bc48-2897b79089e2"  >Persia</placeName>, enticed a
Jew, whose name was <persName xml:id="recogito-faeb1f72-9783-4727-baaf-49b8ac1fbb5f">R. Moses</persName>, to come with him, and when he came to
the land of <placeName xml:id="recogito-f8734b26-8b46-4add-97f9-1af8e8f59c55"  >Persia</placeName> this horseman made the Jew his slave. One day the
archers came before the king to give a display of their skill and no
one among them could be found to draw the bow like this <persName xml:id="recogito-0dd1a9a0-c050-485c-b5ea-b83fd04a0067">R. Moses</persName>. Then
the king inquired of him by means of an interpreter who knew his
language, and he related all that the horseman had done to him.
Thereupon the king at once granted him his liberty, had him clad in
robes of silk, gave him gifts, and said to him, "If thou wilt embrace
our religion, I will make thee a rich man and steward of my house,"
but he answered, "My lord, I cannot do this thing." Then the king took
him and placed him in the house of the Chief Rabbi of the <placeName xml:id="recogito-ca2c7fe1-e604-497c-9bfc-b853fb666137"  >Ispahan</placeName>

who read the stars, and are all black in colour. They are honest in
commerce. When merchants come to them from distant lands and enter the
harbour, three of the King's secretaries go down to them and record
their names, and then bring them before the King, whereupon the King
makes himself responsible even for their property which they leave in
the open, unprotected. There is an official who sits in his office,
and the owner of any lost property has only to describe it to him when
he hands it back. This custom prevails in all that country. From
Passover to New Year, that is all during the summer, no man can go out
of his house because of the sun, for the heat in that country is
intense, and from the third hour of the day onward, everybody remains
in his house till the evening. Then they go forth and kindle lights in
all the market places and all the streets, and then do their work and
business at night-time.

For they have to turn night into day in consequence of the great heat
of the sun. Pepper is found there. They plant the trees thereof in the
fields, and each man of the city knows his own plantation. The trees
are small, and the pepper is as white as snow. And when they have
collected it, they place it in saucepans and pour boiling water over
it, so that it may become strong. They then take it out of the water
and dry it in the sun, and it turns black. Calamus and ginger and many
other kinds of spice are found in this land.

The people of this country do not bury their dead, but embalm them by
means of various spices, after which they place them on chairs and
cover them with fine linen. And each family has a house where it
preserves the embalmed remains of its ancestors and relations. The
flesh hardens on the bones, and the embalmed bodies look like living
beings, so that every man can recognize his parents, and the members
of his family for many years.

<pb n="92"/>

They worship the sun, and they have high places everywhere outside the
city at a distance of about half a mile. And every morning they run
forth to greet the sun, for on every high place a solar disc is made
of cunning workmanship and as the sun rises the disc rotates with
thundering noise, and all, both men and women, offer incense to the
sun with censers in their hands. Such are their superstitious
practices. And throughout the island, including all the towns there,
live several thousand Israelites. The inhabitants are all black, and
the Jews also. The latter are good and benevolent. They know the law
of Moses and the prophets, and to a small extent the Talmud and
Halacha.</seg>

Thence it is twenty-three days by sea to <placeName>Ibrig</placeName><note n="173"/>, and the
inhabitants are fire-worshippers, and are called Duchbin. Among them
are about 3,000 Jews, and these Duchbin have priests in their several
temples who are great wizards in all manner of witchcraft, and there
are none like them in all the earth. In front of the high place of
their temple there is a deep trench, where they keep a great fire
alight all the year, and they call it Elahutha.

<pb n="93"/>

And they cause their sons and daughters to pass through the fire, and
even their dead they throw into it. Some of the great men of the
country make a vow to die by fire. In such cases the man communicates
his intention to the members of his household and his relations, and
says:--"I have vowed to throw myself in the fire whilst I am yet
alive," then they answer, saying: "Happy art thou." And when the day
of the performance of his vow arrives, they prepare for him a grand
banquet, and if he is rich he rides on horseback, if poor he goes on
foot to the border of the trench and throws himself into the fire. And
all the members of his family shout to the accompaniment of timbrels
and dancing until the body is entirely consumed. At the end of three
days two of their high priests come to his house and to his children
and say unto them: "Arrange the house, for this day your father will
come to give his last directions as to what ye shall do." And they
bring witnesses from the city. Then Satan is made to appear in the
likeness of the deceased, and when his widow and children ask him how
he fares in the other world he answers: "I went to my companions, but
they would not receive me until I had discharged my obligations to the
members of my house and to my neighbours."

<pb n="94"/>

Then he makes his will and divides his property among his children,
and gives directions that all his creditors should be paid and that
his debts should be collected. Then the witnesses write out the will,
and he goes his way and is seen no more. And by means of this trickery
and witchcraft which these priests practise, the people are confirmed
in their errors and assert that there is none in all the land like
their priests.</seg>

armed with knives, plunge into the sea. A great bird called the

puts him down on a mountain or in a hollow in order to devour him. The

hires workmen, who dig deep trenches in his field, and fish come with
the rise of the water and enter the trenches. Then, when the waters
have receded, the fish remain behind in the trenches, and the owners
of the fields take them and either eat them or sell them to the
fishmongers, who salt them and deal in them in every place. These fish
are exceedingly fat and large, and the oil obtained from them is used

In the month of Nisan they have cherries, pears, cucumbers, and gourds

excellent architecture. Outside the town is the academy of <persName xml:id="recogito-957217f9-812e-46ab-8efc-d439129d4db8">Aristotle</persName>,
the teacher of <persName xml:id="recogito-87e4e14c-85de-497a-96ee-12f5f4b6ae3f">Alexander</persName>. This is a large building, standing between
other academies to the number of twenty, with a column of marble
between each. People from the whole world were wont to come hither in
order to study the wisdom of <persName xml:id="recogito-bfda7cbd-1aa0-41b7-90a7-29a461361f5e">Aristotle</persName> the philosopher.

The city is built over a hollow by means of arches. <persName xml:id="recogito-283afea4-4120-447c-ae2e-a6c8b2d7defa">Alexander</persName> built it
with great understanding. The streets are wide and straight, so that a
man can look along them for a mile from gate to gate, from the gate of
<placeName xml:id="recogito-56144fbc-d70f-4bb1-a045-46d0bcb7944e"  >Reshid</placeName> to the gate by the sea.

<persName xml:id="recogito-dc1948a8-37fe-41b7-8209-396da9169924">Alexander</persName> also built for the harbour of <placeName xml:id="recogito-13bde73e-1001-46c6-a2c1-ac6c92f09847"  >Alexandria</placeName> a pier, a king's
highway running into the midst of the sea. And there he erected a
large tower, a lighthouse, called Manar al Iskandriyyah in Arabic. On
the top of the tower there is a glass mirror. Any ships that attempted
to attack or molest the city, coming from <placeName xml:id="recogito-cae5b72d-6f9f-43bb-918a-4dac95df29f3"  >Greece</placeName> or from the Western
lands, could be seen by means of this mirror of glass at a distance of
twenty days' journey, and the inhabitants could thereupon put
themselves on their guard. It happened once, many years after the
death of <persName xml:id="recogito-34bfb29c-1099-44d7-bd65-f120b6569c83">Alexander</persName>, that a ship came from the land of <placeName xml:id="recogito-bbc857d7-0466-44ad-972b-5a0a5daaeba6"  >Greece</placeName>, and the
name of the captain was <persName xml:id="recogito-a1c21445-0807-4399-8197-79cc88353948">Theodoros</persName>, a Greek of great cleverness. The
Greeks at that time were under the yoke of <placeName xml:id="recogito-65b56cf7-afbe-4d6b-914e-e6bc913baa21"  >Egypt</placeName>. The captain brought
great gifts in silver and gold and garments of silk to the King of
<placeName xml:id="recogito-5f31660c-5d0e-4812-9fb7-338c5e11d896"  >Egypt</placeName>, and he moored his ship in front of the lighthouse, as was the
custom of all merchants.

<pb n="105"/>

Every day the guardian of the lighthouse and his servants had their
meals with him, until the captain came to be on such friendly terms
with the keeper that he could go in and out at all times. And one day
he gave a banquet, and caused the keeper and all his servants to drink
a great deal of wine. When they were all asleep, the captain and his
servants arose and broke the mirror and departed that very night.</seg></ab><ab xml:id="GeoNar37"> <seg xml:id="GN37S1">From

Israel will not meet with happiness nor live with Israel. When the

gather them." As for the towns which have been mentioned, they contain
scholars and communities that love their brethren, and speak peace to
those that are near and afar, and when a wayfarer comes they rejoice,
and make a feast for him, and say, "Rejoice, brethren, for the help of
the Lord comes in the twinkling of an eye." If we were not afraid that
the appointed time has not yet arrived nor been reached, we would have
gathered together, but we dare not do so until the time for song has
arrived, and the voice of the turtle-dove (is heard in the land), when
the messengers will come and say continually, "The Lord be exalted."
