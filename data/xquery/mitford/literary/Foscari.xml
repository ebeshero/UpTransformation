				<note>This edition compares the first 1826 published edition of Mitford's play <title>Foscari</title> against the manuscript version of the play held in the British Library, and against the final published text of 1854.</note>
				<note>The hand-writing in the manuscript verion of the play appears to be that of a copyist rather than Mary Russell Mitford. The manuscript, which was submitted to the Lord Chamberlain's Office for review, is dated 30 October 1826 and is titled <title>Foscari, a Tragedy in Five Acts</title>.</note>

				<handNote>The manuscript of 1826 does not appear to be written in Mitford's hand, but rather in the hand of a copyist. A second hand in pencil has renumbered the pages for inclusion in this volume of Plays from the Lord Chamberlain's Office, folio pages 341-450.</handNote>

				<p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

<!-- err: The prose preface that appears in the 1854 edition is much shorter than the one that appears in the 1826 published edition, as it only includes the first paragraph of the version that is printed in 1826. There are also one or two wordings that are different in the 1854 edition as well (including the fact that the 1854 preface does not have a title at all, although it is certainly functioning as a preface). I'm not sure if this is the right way to code the variations between the two versions of the preface. I couldn't figure out a way to do it that didn't include coding the preface twice (once for the 1826 version, and once for the 1854 version). -->			
			
			
<!-- err: A verse "Epilogue to 'Foscari'" appears only in the mansucript version of the play, and in the ms, for some reason it appears immediately after the title page, before even the prologue the play. -->

							<l>Why this, indeed, </l>

							<l>Perhaps I love </l>

							<l>To creep upon her in love's loveliest hour, </l>

							<l>And white and delicate, under the cool moon </l>

							<l>There is no cause for fear. This sudden storm </l>

							<l>And ye, the equal judges, spare the son </l>
							<l>This miserable duty. I can tell, </l>
							<l>For I by chance was there, this tale of blood </l>
							<l>And mystery. The late unhappy feud </l>
							<l>Is known to all. Returning from St. Mark's </l>
							<l>With my young kinsman in his Gondola--- </l>
							<l>For I had missed of mine---we landed close </l>
							<l>To the Donato Palace, as the bell </l>
							<l>Was tolling midnight. 'Twas an awful storm; </l>
							<l>But by the flashing lightning we saw one </l>
							<l>Leap from the balcony---a Cavalier </l>
							<l>Splendid in dress and air. The lightning glared </l>
							<l>Full on his face and habit, unconcealed </l>
							<l>By hat or cloak, and instantly we knew </l>
							<l>Francesco Foscari.</l>
						</sp>
						<sp>

						<sp>

						<sp>
							<speaker>Erizzo.</speaker>
							<l>He passed so close Count Zeno, </l>
							<l>That my cloak brushed his vest; but sprang aside, </l>
							<l>As he had met an adder, and leaped down </l>
							<l>Into a waiting Gondola. I called, </l>
							<l>But Foscari answered not; and Cosmo spake, </l>
							<l>Betwixt a sigh and smile, of fair Camilla, </l>
							<l>Of their long loves, and of the morning's ire, </l>
							<l>And how he hoped this dark and sudden cloud </l>
							<l>Would speedily pass away. Even as he spake, </l>
							<l>Whilst loitering on the steps, we heard a shriek </l>
							<l>Within the house, so piercing, so prolonged, </l>
							<l>So born of bitter anguish---to this hour </l>
							<l>That shriek is ringing in mine ears! And when, </l>
							<pb n="51"/>
							<l>With trembling hearts and failing limbs, we scaled </l>
							<l>The stairs, we saw Donato bathed in blood, </l>
							<l>And poor Camilla lying on his breast, </l>
							<l>Her arms strained round his neck, as if she tried </l>
							<l>To keep in his dear life. </l>

							<l>I dare not think, </l>
							<l>For thought is frenzy. Lords! The Count Erizzo </l>
							<l>Hath told ye how we found the corse. This sword, </l>
							<l>The well-known sword of Foscari, was plunged </l>
							<l>Deep in his gory breast; beside him lay </l>
							<l>This hat and cloak, the splendid soldier's garb </l>
							<l>Of Foscari; no man had approached the house </l>
							<l>Save only Foscari; and his last word, </l>
							<l>Mingled with cries of murder and of help, </l>

Though losing the appointment to Foscari, Loredan went on to continue his distinguished military career, along with his son, Giacomo (or Jacopo) Loredan, who also embarked upon a military career. Given the fact that Pietro Loredan died in 1438 (as well as the fact that the Foscari and Loredan families were bitter rivals), Mitford's fictional Loredano, whom the fictional Foscari has appointed as the new Procurator is likely only loosely based on the historical Pietro Loredan (if at all).</note>
