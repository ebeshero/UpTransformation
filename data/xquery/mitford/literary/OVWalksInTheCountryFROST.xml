            <!--MAH: June 20th:: This piece as well as THAW appear to be two parts of the same sketch, "Walks in the Country," I have them as two separate pieces, unsure how we'll want to show them later, but they should be relatively easy to combine. There will be a similar note in THAW to show that they are tied together.-->

There had been just snow enough to cover the earth and all its colours with one sheet of pure and uniform white, and just time enough since the snow had fallen to allow the <rs type="plant" nymRef="plant">hedges</rs> to be freed of their fleecy load, and clothed with a delicate coating of rime. The atmosphere was deliciously calm; soft, even mild, in spite of the thermometer; no perceptible air, but a stillness that might almost be felt; the sky, rather grey than blue, throwing out in bold relief the snow-covered roofs of <placeName ref="#ThreeMileCross">our village,</placeName> and the rimy <rs type="plant" nymRef="tree">trees</rs> that rise above them, and the sun shining dimly as through a veil, giving a pale fair light, like the moon, only brighter. There was a silence, too, that might become the moon, as we stood<pb n="27"/>at our little gate looking up the quiet street; a sabbath-like pause of work and play, rare on a work-day; nothing was audible but the pleasant hum of frost, that low monotonous sound, which is perhaps the nearest approach that life and nature can make to absolute silence. The very waggons as they come down the <placeName type="land">hill</placeName> along the beaten track of crisp yellowish frost-dust, glide along like shadows; even <persName ref="#May-flower">May's</persName> bounding footsteps, at her height of glee and of speed, fall like snow upon snow. </p><p>But we shall have noise enough presently: <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#May-flower">May</persName> has stopped at <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Lizzy">Lizzy's</persName> door; and <persName ref="#Lizzy">Lizzy</persName>, as she sate on the window-sill, with her bright rosy face laughing through the casement, has seen her and disappeared. She is coming. No! The key is turning in the door, and sounds of evil omen issue through the key-hole—sturdy <said who="#Lizzy">'let-me-outs'</said>,<!--scw: single quotation marks--><!--scw: MRM often renders dialogue indirectly, as here with Lizzy's protests being rendered in plural. See also ending dialogue between narrator and presumably her father in "Hannah." TEI evidently has advice for direct and indirect speech/quotation, which may have to be considered more carefully than I have here.--> and <said who="#Lizzy">'I will gos',</said> mixed with shrill cries on <persName ref="#May-flower">May</persName> and on me from <persName ref="#Lizzy">Lizzy</persName>, piercing through a low continuous harangue, of which the prominent parts are apologies, chilblains, sliding, broken bones, lollypops, rods, and gingerbread, from <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#LizzysMother">Lizzy's careful mother</persName>. <said who="#OVNarrator">'Don't scratch the door, <persName ref="#May-flower">May</persName>! Don't roar so, my <persName ref="#Lizzy">Lizzy</persName>! We'll call for you as we come back.'</said>— <said who="#Lizzy">'I'll go now! Let me out! I will go!'</said> are the last words of <persName ref="#Lizzy">Miss Lizzy</persName>. <abbr>Mem.</abbr> Not to spoil that <rs type="person" ref="#Lizzy">child</rs>—if I can help it. But I do think <rs type="person" ref="#LizzysMother">her mother</rs> might have let the <rs type="person" ref="Lizzy">poor little soul</rs> walk with us to-day. No-<pb n="28"/>thing worse for children than coddling. Nothing better for chilblains than exercise. Besides, I don't believe she has any—and as to breaking her bones in sliding, I don't suppose there's a slide on the <placeName type="land">common</placeName>. These murmuring cogitations have brought us up the <placeName type="land">hill</placeName>, and half-way across the light and airy <placeName type="land">common</placeName>, with its bright expanse of snow and its clusters of cottages, whose turf fires send such wreaths of smoke sailing up the air, and diffuse such aromatic fragrance around. And now comes the delightful sound of childish voices, ringing with glee and merriment almost from beneath our feet. Ah, <persName ref="#Lizzy">Lizzy</persName>, <persName ref="#LizzysMother">your mother</persName> was right! They are shouting from that <placeName type="land">deep irregular pool</placeName>, all glass now, where, on two long, smooth, liny slides, half a dozen ragged <orgName type="person">urchins</orgName> are slipping along in tottering triumph. Half a dozen steps bring us to the <placeName type="land">bank</placeName> right above them. <persName ref="#May-flower">May</persName> can hardly resist the temptation of joining her friends, for most of the <orgName type="person">varlets</orgName><!--scw: varlets and urchings here tagged as orgName might be refd as CountryBoys--> are of her acquaintance, especially the <rs type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#JackRapley">rogue</rs> who leads the slide,—he with the brimless hat, whose bronzed complexion and white flaxen hair, reversing the usual lights and shadows of the human countenance, give so strange and foreign a look to his flat and comic features. This <rs type="person" ref="#JackRapley">hobgoblin</rs>, <persName type="fict" ref="#JackRapley">Jack Rapley</persName> by name, is <persName ref="#May-flower">May's</persName> great crony; and she stands on the brink of the steep irregular descent, her black eyes fixed full upon him, as if she intended him the favour of jumping on his head. She<pb n="29"/> does: she is down, and upon him: but <persName ref="#JackRapley">Jack Rapley</persName> is not easily to be knocked off his feet. He saw her coming, and in the moment of her leap sprang dexterously off the slide on the rough ice, steading himself by the shoulder of the next in the file, which unlucky follower, thus unexpectedly checked in his career, fell plump backwards, knocking down the rest of the line like a nest of card-houses. There is no harm done; but there they lie roaring, kicking, sprawling, in every attitude of comic distress, whilst <persName ref="#JackRapley">Jack Rapley</persName> and <persName ref="#May-Flower">May-flower,</persName> sole authors of this calamity, stand apart from the throng, fondling, and coquetting, and complimenting each other, and very visibly laughing, <persName ref="#May-flower">May</persName> in her black eyes, <persName ref="#JackRapley">Jack</persName> in his wide close-shut mouth, and his whole monkey-face, at <orgName type="person">their comrades's</orgName> mischances. I think, <persName ref="#May-flower">Miss May</persName>, you may as well come up again, and leave <persName ref="#JackRapley">Master Rapley</persName> to fight your battles. He'll get out of the scrape. He is a <rs type="person" ref="#JackRapley">Rustic wit</rs>—a sort of <persName type="fict" subtype="ext" ref="#RobinGoodfellow">Robin Goodfellow</persName>—the sauciest, idlest, cleverest, best-natured boy in the parish; always foremost in mischief, and always ready to do a good turn. The sages of our village predict sad things of <persName ref="#JackRapley">Jack Rapley</persName>, so that I am sometimes a little ashamed to confess, before wise people, that I have a lurking predilection for him, (in common with other naughty ones), and that I like to hear him talk to <persName ref="#May-flower">May</persName> almost as well as she does. <said who="#OVNarrator">'Come, <persName ref="#May-flower">May!</persName>'</said> and up she springs, as light as a bird.<pb n="30"/> The road is gay now; carts and post-chaises, and <orgName type="person">girls in red cloaks</orgName>, and, afar off, looking almost like a toy, the coach. It meets us fast and soon. How much happier the <orgName type="person">walkers</orgName> look than the <orgName type="person">riders</orgName>—especially the <rs type="person" subtype="fic">frost-bitten gentleman,</rs> and the <rs type="person" subtype="fict">shivering lady</rs> with the invisible face, sole passengers of that commodious machine! Hooded, veiled, and bonneted as she is, one sees from her attitude how miserable she would look uncovered.<!--scw: some of the orgNames and rs people in the foregoing have not been assigned hashtags--></p><p>Another <placeName type="land">pond,</placeName> and another noise of children. More sliding? Oh! no. This is a sport of higher pretension. Our good neighbour, the <persName ref="#Lieutenant">lieutenant</persName>, skaiting,<!--scw: The OED lists various spellings in use in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, including the one used by MRM here.--> and his own <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#LieutenantsChildren">pretty little boys</persName>, and two or three other <orgName type="person">four-year-old elves</orgName>, standing on the brink in an ecstasy of joy and wonder! Oh what happy <orgName type="person">spectators</orgName>! And what a happy <rs type="person" ref="#Lieutenant">performer</rs>! They admiring, he admired, with ardour and sincerity never excited by all the quadrilles and the spread eagles of the <placeName type="geog" ref="#Seine">Seine</placeName> and the <placeName type="geog" ref="#Serpentine">Serpentine</placeName>. He really skaits well though, and I am glad I came this way; for, with all the <rs type="person" ref="#Lieutenant">father's</rs> feelings sitting gaily at his heart, it must still gratify the pride of skill to have one spectator at that solitary <placeName type="land">pond</placeName> who has been skaiting before.</p><p>Now we have reached the <rs type="plant" nymRef="tree">trees</rs>,—the beautiful <rs type="plant" nymRef="tree">trees!</rs> never so beautiful as to-day. Imagine the effect of a straight and regular <placeName type="land">double avenue of <rs type="plant" nymRef="tree">oaks</rs></placeName>, nearly a mile long, arching over head, and closing into perspec<pb n="31"/>tive like the roof and columns of a cathedral, every <rs type="plant" nymRef="tree">tree</rs> and branch encrusted with the bright and delicate congelation of hoar-frost, white and pure as snow, delicate and defined as carved ivory. How beautiful it is, how uniform, how various, how filling, how satiating to the eye and to the mind—above all, how melancholy! There is a thrilling awfulness, an intense feeling of simple power in that naked and colourless beauty, which falls on the heart like the thought of death— death pure, and glorious, and smiling,—but still death. Sculpture has always the same effect on my imagination, and painting never. Colour is life.—We are now at the end of this magnificent <placeName type="land">avenue</placeName>, and at the top of a steep <placeName type="land">eminence</placeName> commanding a wide view over four <orgName type="county">counties</orgName>—a landscape of snow. A <placeName type="geog">deep lane</placeName> leads abruptly down the <placeName type="land">hill</placeName>; a mere narrow cart-track, sinking between high <placeName type="land">banks</placeName> clothed with <rs type="plant" nymRef="plant">fern</rs> and <rs type="plant" nymRef="plant">furze</rs> and low <rs type="plant" nymRef="plant">broom,</rs> crowned with luxuriant <rs type="plant" nymRef="plant">hedgerows</rs>, and famous for their summer smell of <rs type="plant" nymRef="plant">thyme</rs>. How lovely these <placeName type="land">banks</placeName> are now—the tall <rs type="plant" nymRef="plant">weeds</rs> and the <rs type="plant" nymRef="plant">gorse</rs> fixed and stiffened in the hoar frost, which fringes round the bright prickly <rs type="plant" nymRef="plant">holly</rs>, the pendant foliage of the <rs type="plant" nymRef="plant">bramble</rs>, and the deep orange leaves of the <rs type="plant" nymRef="tree">pollard oaks</rs>! Oh, this is rime in its loveliest form! And there is still a berry here and there on the <rs type="plant" nymRef="plant">holly</rs>, <quote>"blushing in its natural coral"</quote><!--scw: I have not yet been able to identify this quote--> through the delicate tracery, still a stray hip or haw for the birds, who abound here always. The poor<pb n="32"/> birds, how tame they are, how sadly tame! There is the beautiful and rare crested wren, <quote>"that shadow of a bird,"</quote><note resp="#ad"> Letter XLI to <persName>Thomas Pennant</persName>in <title>The Natural History of Selborne</title> (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books Ltd, 1987), p. 97. </note>as <bibl><persName type="hist" subtype="ext" ref="#WhiteGilbert">White</persName> of <placeName ref="#Selborne">Selborne</placeName></bibl> calls it, perched in the middle of the <rs type="plant" nymRef="plant">hedge</rs>, nestling as it were amongst the cold bare boughs, seeking, poor pretty thing, for the warmth it will not find. And there, farther on, just under the <placeName type="land">bank</placeName>, by the slender <placeName type="land">runlet</placeName>, which still trickles between its transparent fantastic margin of thin ice, as if it were a thing of life,—there, with a swift, scudding motion, flits, in short low flights, the gorgeous kingfisher, its magnificent plumage of scarlet and blue flashing in the sun, like the glories of some tropical bird. He is come for water to this little <placeName type="land">spring</placeName> by the <placeName type="land">hill side</placeName>,—water which even his long bill and slender head can hardly reach, so nearly do the fantastic forms of those garland-like icy margins meet over the <placeName type="land">tiny stream</placeName> beneath. It is rarely that one sees the shy beauty so close or so long; and it is pleasant to see him in the grace and beauty of his natural liberty, the only way to look at a bird. We used, before we lived in a street, to fix a little board outside the parlour-window, and cover it with bread-crumbs in the hard winter. It was quite delightful to see the pretty things come and feed, to conquer their shyness, and do away their mistrust. First came the more social tribes, <quote>"the robin red-breast and the wren,"</quote><!--scw: unable to identify this quote with certainty, but it's possible MRM is quoting from a folksong, as there were several old folksongs containing this line. For example: "The robin redbreast and the wren / Coost out about the supper pan; / And or the robin gat a spune / Kitty had the supper dune." (p.558) Quoted in Edward Newman, The Zoologist: A Popular Miscellany of Natural History. London: John Vander Voorst, 1849:558. Google Books. The source quotes other songs containing this line as well. --> cautiously, suspiciously, picking up a crumb on the wing, with the little keen bright<pb n="33"/> eye fixed on the window; then they would stop for two pecks; then stay till they were satisfied. The shyer birds, tamed by their example, came next; and at last one saucy fellow of a blackbird—a sad glutton, he would clear the board in two minutes,—How we loved the fearless confidence of that fine, frank-hearted creature! And surely he loved us. I wonder the practice is not more general.— <said who="#OVNarrator">"<persName ref="#May-flower">May</persName>! <persName ref="#May-flower">May</persName>! naughty <persName ref="#May-flower">May</persName>!"</said> She has frightened away the kingfisher; and now, in her coaxing penitence, she is covering me with snow. <said who="#OVNarrator">"Come, <persName ref="#May-flower">pretty May</persName>! it is time to go home."</said></p></div></body><back><div><listPerson>
