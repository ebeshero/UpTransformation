                    of such vigour and hardiness, that they seem constituted for an interminable
                    duration, a sort of immortality. An old <rs type="plant" ref="#pollard_oak">pollard oak</rs> of my acquaintance
                    used to give me this impression. Never was <rs type="plant" ref="#pollard_oak">tree so gnarled, so knotted, so full
                        of crooked life</rs>. <rs type="plant" ref="#pollard_oak">Garlanded with <rs type="plant" ref="#ivy">ivy</rs> and <rs type="plant" ref="#woodbine">woodbine</rs>,
                    almost bending under the weight of its own rich leaves and <rs type="plant" ref="#acorns">acorns</rs>, tough,
                    vigorous, lusty, concentrating as it were the very spirit of vitality into its
                    own curtailed proportions</rs>,—could that tree ever die? <persName ref="#OVNarrator">I</persName> have asked myself twenty
                    times, as I stood looking on the deep water over which it hung, and in which it
                    seemed to live again—would that strong dwarf ever fall? Alas! the question is
                    answered. Walking by the spot to-day—this very day—there it lay prostrate; the
                    <rs type="plant" ref="#ivy">ivy</rs> still clinging about it, 
                    the twigs swelling with sap, and putting forth
                    already the early buds. There it lay a victim to the taste and skill of some
                    admirer <pb n="164"/> of British woods, who with the tact of <persName type="hist" ref="#Ugo_Foscolo">Ugo Foscolo</persName> (that
                    prince of amateurs) has discovered in the knots and gnarls of the exterior coat
                    the leopard-like beauty which is concealed within the trunk. There it lies, a
                    type of sylvan instability, fallen like an emperor. Another piece of strong
                    nature in a human form used to convey to me exactly the same feeling—and he is
                    gone too! <persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom Cordery</persName> is dead. 
                    The bell is tolling for him at this very moment.
                    <persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom Cordery</persName> dead! the words seem 
                    almost a contradiction. One is tempted to send
                    for the sexton and the undertaker, to undig the grave, to force open the
                    coffin-lid—there must be some mistake. But, alas! it is too true; the typhus
                    fever, that axe which levels the strong as the weak, has hewed him down at a
                    blow. Poor <persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom Cordery</persName>!</p><p> This <rs type="person" ref="#Tom_Cordery">human oak</rs> grew on the wild 
                    <rs type="place" subtype="geog" ref="#Berkshire">North-of-<placeName type="geog" ref="#Hampshire">Hampshire</placeName> country</rs>, of which I have
                    before made honourable mention; a country of <placeName type="land" ref="#heath">heath</placeName>, 
                    and <placeName type="land" ref="#hill">hill</placeName>, and <placeName type="land" ref="#forest">forest</placeName>, partly
                    reclaimed, inclosed, and planted by some of the <orgName type="person" ref="#greater_proprietors">&gt;greater proprietors</orgName>, but for the
                    most part uncultivated and uncivilized; a proper refuge for wild animals of
                    every species. Of these the most notable was my friend <persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom Cordery</persName>, who
                    presented in his own person <rs type="person" ref="#Tom_Cordery">no unfit emblem of the district in which he
                        lived</rs>—the <rs type="person" ref="#Tom_Cordery">gentlest of savages</rs>, 
                    the <rs type="person" ref="#Tom_Cordery">wildest of civilized men</rs>. He was by calling
                    rat-catcher, hare-finder, and broom- <pb n="165"/> maker; a triad of trades
                    which he had substituted for the one grand profession of poaching, which he
                    followed in his younger days with unrivalled talent and success, and would,
                    undoubtedly, have pursued till his death, had not the bursting of an overloaded
                    gun unluckily shot off his left hand. As it was, he still contrived to mingle a
                    little of his old unlawful occupation with his honest callings; was a reference
                    of high authority amongst the young aspirants, an adviser of undoubted honour
                    and secrecy—suspected, and more than suspected, as being one <quote>"who, though he
                        played no more, o'erlooked the cards."</quote><!--scw: unidentifed yet--> Yet he kept to windward of the law, and
                    indeed contrived to be on such terms of social and even friendly intercourse
                    with the <orgName type="person" ref="#guardians_of_game">guardians of the game</orgName> on <placeName type="land" ref="#M_Common">M. Common</placeName>, as may be said to prevail between
                    reputed thieves and the <persName type="myth" subtype="ext" ref="#myrmidons">myrmidons</persName> of justice in the neighbourhood of <placeName ref="#Bow_street">Bow-street</placeName>.
                    Indeed his especial crony, the <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#head_keeper">head-keeper</persName>, 
                    used sometimes to hint, when <persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom</persName>,
                    elevated by ale, had provoked him by overcrowing, <said who="#head_keeper">"that a stump was no bad
                    shield, and that to shoot off a hand and a bit of an arm for a blind, would be
                    nothing to so daring a chap as <persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom Cordery</persName>."</said> This conjecture, never broached
                    till the <persName ref="#head_keeper">keeper</persName> was warm with wrath and 
                    liquor, and <persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom</persName> fairly out of hearing,
                    seemed always to me a little super-subtle; but it is certain that 
                    <persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom</persName>'s new
                    professions did bear rather a suspicious analogy to the <pb n="166"/> old, and
                    the ferrets, and terriers, and mongrels by whom he was surrounded, 
                    <said who="#head_keeper">"did really
                        look,"</said> as the worthy <persName ref="#head_keeper">keeper</persName> observed, <said who="#head_keeper">"fitter to find Christian hares and
                            pheasants, than rats and such vermin."</said> So in 
                    good truth did <persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom</persName> himself. Never
                    did any human being look more like that sort of sportsman commonly called a
                    poacher. He was a tall, finely-built man, with a prodigious stride, that cleared
                    the ground like a horse, and a power of continuing his slow and steady speed,
                    that seemed nothing less than miraculous. Neither man, nor horse, nor dog, could
                    out-tire him. He had a bold, undaunted presence, and an evident strength and
                    power of bone and muscle. You might see by looking at him, that he did not know
                    what fear meant. In his youth he had fought more battles than any man in the
                    forest. He was as if born without nerves, totally insensible to the recoils and
                    disgusts of humanity. <persName ref="#OVNarrator">I</persName> have known 
                    him take up a huge adder, cut off its head,
                    and then deposit the living and writhing body in his brimless hat, and walk with
                    it coiling and wreathing about his head, like another <persName type="myth" ref="#Medusa">Medusa</persName>, till the sport of
                    the day was over, and he carried it home to secure the fat. With all this iron
                    stubbornness of nature, he was of a most mild and gentle demeanour, had a fine
                    placidity of countenance, and a quick blue eye beaming with good-humour. His
                    face was sunburnt into one general <pb n="167"/> pale vermilion hue that
                    overspread all his features; his very hair was sunburnt too. His costume was
                    generally a smock-frock of no doubtful complexion, dirt-coloured, which hung
                    round him in tatters like fringe, rather augmenting than diminishing the
                    freedom, and, if I may so say, the gallantry of his bearing. This frock was
                    furnished with a huge inside pocket, in which to deposit the game killed by his
                    patrons—for of his three employments, that which consisted of finding hares for
                    the <orgName type="person" ref="#great_farmers">great farmers</orgName> and <orgName type="person" ref="#small_gentry">small gentry</orgName>, who were wont to course on the <placeName type="land" ref="#common">common</placeName>, was
                    by far the most profitable and most pleasing to him, and to them. Every body
                    liked <persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom Cordery</persName>. 
                    He had himself an aptness to like, which is certain to be
                    repaid in kind— the very dogs knew him, and loved him, and would beat for him
                    almost as soon as for their master. Even <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#May-flower">May</persName>, 
                    the most sagacious of greyhounds,
                    appreciated his talents, and would as soon listen to 
                    <persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom</persName> sohoing as to old

                    giving tongue.</p><p>Nor was his conversation less agreeable to the other part of the company.
                    <orgName type="person" ref="#servants">Servants</orgName> and <orgName type="person" ref="#masters">masters</orgName> 
                    were equally desirous to secure <persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom</persName>. Besides his general
                    and professional familiarity with beasts and birds, their ways and doings, a
                    knowledge so minute and accurate, that it might have put to shame many a
                    professed naturalist, he had no small acquaintance with the goings-on of that
                    unfeathered biped called man; in short, he was, <pb n="168"/> next after <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>,
                    who recognised his rivalry by hating, decrying, and undervaluing him, by far the
                    best news-gatherer of the country side. His news he of course picked up on the
                    civilized side of the <orgName>parish</orgName>,<!--scw: the parish needs to be verified; probably Swallowfield rather than Shinfield.--> (
                    there is no gossiping in the <placeName type="land" ref="#forest">forest</placeName>,) partly at
                    that well-frequented inn the <orgName ref="#Red_Lion">Red Lion</orgName>, 
                    of which <persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom</persName> was a regular and noted
                    supporter—partly amongst his several employers and partly by his own sagacity.
                    In the matter of marriages, (pairings he was wont to call them,) he relied
                    chiefly on his own skill in noting certain preliminary indications; and
                    certainly for a guesser by profession and a very bold one, he was astonishingly
                    often right. At the <orgName ref="#alehouse">alehouse</orgName> especially, he was of the first authority. An air
                    of mild importance, a diplomatic reserve on some points, great smoothness of
                    speech, and that gentleness which is so often the result of conscious power,
                    made him there an absolute ruler. Perhaps the effect of these causes might be a
                    little aided by the latent dread which that power inspired in others. Many an
                    exploit had proved that <persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom Cordery</persName>'s 
                    one arm was fairly worth any two on the
                    common. The pommelling of <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Bob_Arlott">Bob Arlott</persName>, and 
                    the levelling of <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Jem_Serle">Jem Serle</persName> to the
                    earth by one swing of a huge old hare, (which unusual weapon was by the way the

                    to us in that walking cupboard, his

                    as far as concerned the beat, and was sure to bring them round to his own

                    them aside from the direction indicated, and however often

                    in this point. Half the one, perhaps, and half the other. Mixed motives, let

                    his disciples say what they will, are by far the commonest in this

                    Another pet spot was <placeName type="land" ref="#Gallows_piece">the Gallows-piece</placeName>, an inclosure almost as large as the
                    <placeName type="land" ref="#Hundred_Acres">Hundred Acres</placeName>, where a gibbet had once borne the bodies of <orgName type="person" ref="#two_murderers">two murderers</orgName>, with
                    the chains and bones, even in my remembrance, clanking and creaking in the wind.
                    The gibbet was gone now; but the name remained, and the feeling, deep, sad, and
                    shuddering. The <placeName type="land" ref="#Gallows_piece">place</placeName>, too, 
                    was wild, awful, fearful; a heathy, furzy spot,
                    sinking into <placeName type="land" ref="#hollow">broken hollows</placeName>, 
                    where murderers might lurk; a few <rs type="plant" ref="#pine">withered pines</rs> at

                    thither a second time.<!--scw: A grad student of mine found an interesting story about hanged murderers and a Red Lion inn that might be what MRM is referencing here. Will have to consult his sources.--></p><p><persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom</persName> was not, however, 
                    without that strong sense of natural beauty which they who

                    was scarcely less his
                    admiration than mine. It is a <placeName type="land" ref="#hill">high hill</placeName>,

                    <rs type="plant" ref="#broom">broom</rs>, and sinking abruptly down to a <placeName type="land" ref="#pond">large pond</placeName>, almost a lake, covered with

                    rises on the other side with equal abruptness, as if shutting in those glassy
                    waters from all but the sky, which shines so brightly in their clear bosom: just
                    in the bottom peeps a small sheltered farm, whose wreaths of light smoke and the
                    white glancing wings of the wild ducks, as they flit across the lake, are all
                    that give token of motion or of life. <persName ref="#OVNarrator">I</persName> 
                    have stood there in utter oblivion of

                    by his exclamations of delight at its

                    which a poet or a painter (for it
                    breathes the very spirit of calm and sunshiny beauty that a master-painter
                    loves) would ex<pb n="172"/>press by different but not truer praise. He called
                    his own home <quote><soCalled>"pleasant"</soCalled></quote> too; and there, 
                    though one loves to hear any home so
                    called—there, I must confess, that favourite phrase, which <persName ref="#OVNarrator">I</persName> like almost as well
                    as they who have no other, did seem rather misapplied. And yet it was finely
                    placed, very finely. It stood in a sort of <placeName type="land">defile</placeName>, 
                    where a <placeName type="geog" ref="#road">road</placeName> almost
                    perpendicular wound from the top of a <placeName type="land" ref="#hill">steep abrupt hill</placeName>, 
                    crowned with a tuft of
                        old <rs type="plant" ref="#Scottish_fir_tree">Scottish firs</rs>, 
                    into a <placeName type="land" ref="#dingle">dingle of <rs type="plant" ref="#fern">fern</rs> and <rs type="plant" ref="#brushwood">wild brushwood</rs></placeName>. A <placeName type="land" ref="#stream">shallow, sullen

                    the <placeName type="geog">road</placeName>, sank into a <placeName type="land" ref="#pool">dark, deep pool</placeName>, half hidden amongst the <placeName type="land" ref="#sallows">sallows</placeName>. Behind
                    these <placeName type="land" ref="#sallows">sallows</placeName>, in a nook between them and 
                    <placeName type="land" ref="#hill">the hill</placeName>, rose the uncouth and
                    shapeless cottage of <persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom Cordery</persName>.  
                    It is a scene which hangs upon the eye and the
                    memory, striking, grand, almost sublime, and above all eminently foreign. No
                    English painter would choose such a subject for an English landscape; no one in
                    a picture would take it for English. It might pass for one of those scenes which
                    have furnished models to <persName type="hist" ref="#Salvator_Rosa">Salvator Rosa</persName>. 
                    <persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom</persName>'s cottage was, however, very
                    thoroughly national and characteristic; a low, ruinous hovel, the door of which
                    was fastened with a sedulous attention to security, that contrasted strangely
                    with the tattered thatch of the roof, and the half-broken windows. No garden, no
                    pigsty, <pb n="173"/> no pens for geese, none of the usual signs of cottage
                    habitation:—yet the house was covered with nondescript dwellings, and the very
                    walls were animate with their extraordinary tenants: pheasants, partridges,
                    rabbits, tame wild ducks, half-tame hares, and their enemies by nature and
                    education, the ferrets, terriers, and mongrels, of whom his retinue consisted.
                    Great ingenuity had been evinced in keeping separate these jarring elements; and
                    by dint of hutches, cages, fences, kennels, and half a dozen little hurdled
                    inclosures, resembling the sort of courts which children are apt to build round
                    their card-houses, peace was in general tolerably well preserved. Frequent
                    sounds, however, of fear or of anger, as their several instincts were aroused,
                    gave token that it was but a forced and hollow truce, and at such times the
                    clamour was prodigious. <persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom</persName> had the 
                    remarkable tenderness for animals when
                    domesticated, which is so often found in those whose sole vocation seems to be
                    their destruction in the field; and the one long, straggling, unceiled,
                    barn-like room, which served for kitchen, bed-chamber, and hall, was cumbered
                    with bipeds and quadrupeds of all kinds and descriptions—the sick, the delicate,
                    the newly caught, the lying-in. In the midst of this menagerie sate 
                    <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Tom_Corderys_wife">Tom's wife</persName>,
                    (for he was married, though without a family—married to a

                    he himself was mi<pb n="174"/>nus an arm,) now trying to quiet her noisy
                    inmates, now to outscold them. How long his friend 
                    <persName ref="#head_keeper">the keeper</persName> would have
                    continued to wink at this den of live game, none can say: the roof fairly fell

                    fine litters of rabbits as ever were kittened. Remotely, I have no doubt that he
                    himself fell a sacrifice to this misadventure. The 
                    <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#overseer">overseer</persName>, to whom he applied
                    to re-instate his beloved habitation, decided that the walls would never bear
                    another roof, and removed him and <persName ref="#Tom_Corderys_wife">his wife</persName>, 
                    as an especial favour, to a tidy,
                    snug, comfortable room in the <orgName ref="#workhouse">workhouse</orgName>. 
                    The <orgName ref="#workhouse">workhouse</orgName>! From that hour poor 
                    <persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom</persName>
                    visibly altered. He lost his hilarity and independence. It was a change such as
                    he had himself often inflicted, a complete change of habits, a transition from
                    the wild to the tame. No labour was demanded of him; he went about as before,
                    finding hares, killing rats, selling brooms, but the spirit of the man was
                    departed. He talked of the quiet of his old abode, and the noise of the new;
                    complained of <orgName type="person" ref="#workhouse_children">children</orgName> and other 
                    bad company; and looked down on his neighbours
                    with the sort of contempt with which a cock pheasant might regard a barn-door
                    fowl. Most of all did he, braced into a gipsey-like defiance of wet and cold,
                    grumble at the warmth and dryness of his apartment. He used to foretell that it
                    would kill him, and <pb n="175"/> assuredly it did so. Never could the typhus
                    fever have found out that <placeName type="land" ref="#hill">wild hill side</placeName>, 
                    or have lurked under that broken roof. The free touch of the air 
                    would have chased the daemon. Alas, poor <persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom</persName>! 
                    warmth, and snugness,
                    and comfort, whole windows, and an entire ceiling, 
                    were the death of him. Alas, poor <persName ref="#Tom_Cordery">Tom</persName>!<pb n="176"/></p></div></body>
        <!--scw, Sept. 8, 2014: a few sketchy notes on this sketch: 
            Tom Cordery's name appears on a 
            Berkshire enclosure map from 1817 (in Box), as does the name of an Ann Cordery. They both
            apparently received allotments of land on Farley Hill Common upon the enclosure.
            The map is a little blurry, but it looks to me like Farley Hill Common isn't located
            but is indicated by a road "to Farley Hill Common," just to the right of where it reads Mag Green at the upper left.
            (I can make out a Farley Hill House, however, center top; it's reddish.) Down towards the lower right cluster of 
            grounds, near the Heckfield parish border, I can make out what looks like the word "work house." 
            (May be the same workhouse mentioned in other sketches.) I can't decipher any of the other spots that MRM refers to
            in this sketch, so either the resolution is awful or MRM is
            screening certain aspects of the locale.-->
