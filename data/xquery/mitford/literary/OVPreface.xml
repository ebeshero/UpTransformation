   <!--EBB: June 12, 2013: Our document is well-formed XML, but it's invalid TEI (and oXygen is fightin' mad) because it's lacking paragraphs! We couldn't mark those due to the conditions of importing the text from HathiTrust, so alas, we must carefully locate and mark paragraphs from start to finish.
    This is an Excellent Task for my research assistant Meg Hughes! Meg, would you help us add paragraph breaks? You can compare this text against the PDF copy of our text (sitting here in the same Box folder), so you can see where to put the <p> and </p><p> tags. You'll also need to make occasional corrections to our text here in the XML. It's pretty clean, but there are occasional OCR errors. I've tried to remove the running heads in block caps on each page, preserving the sketch title only in the div type="sketch" tag. -->
    
    <!--Sam and Lexi, should we try to meet in a Google Hangout just to work out a good plan for the next phase of editing? There's a LOT we can do with Our Village, and it might make sense to have each of you take a run at this file in turns, to work on a phase of context coding. Alternatively we could divide Our Village into parts, and have each of you concentrate on particular portions of it. That's easily done if we divide this into multiple files. We can all look at each other's code to make sure we're being consistent and talk about things that come up.-->
   
   <!--EBB: June 12, 2013: Reminder: We need to put a Table of Contents on this...But we're also going to break this into MULTIPLE files and generate an external Table of Contents to link to them.-->
   <!--EBB: June 12, 2013: Meeting with Meg now. Meg is breaking each portion of Our Village into its own discreet file, and she'll be adding paragraph tags. ALSO she'll be trying to correct OCR errors and eliminate hyphens from line breaks from the printed text. Lexi and Sam, when each of you work on the file, there may be things we haven't caught, so definitely compare with the published version as you're working! --><titleStmt><title>Our Village: Sketches of Rural Character and Scenery: Preface</title><author>Mary Russell Mitford</author><editor>Alexandra Drayton</editor><editor>Samantha Webb</editor><sponsor><orgName>Mary Russell Mitford Society: Digital Mitford

Her descriptions have always been written on the spot, and at the moment, and in nearly every instance with the closest and most resolute fidelity to the place and the people. If she be accused of having given a brighter aspect to her villagers than is usually met with in books, she cannot help it, and would not if she could. She has painted, as they appeared to her, their little frailties and their many virtues, under an intense and thankful conviction, that in every condition of life goodness and happiness may be found by those who seek
 <pb n="v"/>them, and never more surely than in the fresh air, the shade, and the sunshine of nature.</p><p>A few sketches of character, in a somewhat higher rank, have been introduced; it is right also to add, that the greater part both of them and of the strictly rural papers have already appeared in a periodical publication<!--how to indicate the Lady's Magazine; should also annotate which sketches had already appeared-->.</p><pb n="vi"/></div></body><back>
