   <!--ebb:Note to Digital Mitford Editors: In this typescript, we've noticed the frequent use of the characters XX or X, and my working hypothesis is that these characters indicate points in Mitford's diary that were illegible to the transcriber. However, they also seem to be used in conjunction with titles of books Mitford mentions reading. There is probably some system to this that isn't apparent in the typescript itself. To verify this, we need to consult the original manuscript notebook.--><teiHeader><fileDesc><titleStmt><title>Mary Russell Mitford's Notebook of 1819 to 1823</title><author ref="#MRM">Mary Russell Mitford</author><editor ref="#rjp">Rebecca J.
