               letter——which yet gave us great pain in the indifferent account which it
               contained of your health——I trust that the <placeName ref="#Oxford_Circuit">Circuit</placeName> will set you quite up again——It always
               does——Do you come by <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading </placeName>?
               And if you do can you give us a day? I want you to see my garden in its flush of
               roses and lilies....&amp; I hope we need not say that we always want to see you. Just
               give me one line to say yes or no——&amp; to tell me that you are
               better——it will not be welcome without that——only one line
               mind——I will not have a long letter till you are at leisure, although
               what can have put it into your head that you are a bad letter writer I cannot
               imagine——the only possible fault of your letters would be their being too
               well written—--&amp; really that is so rare a fault that one puts up with it.
               But you have the habit of making mistakes about yourself &amp; being astonished when
               people find them out, <pb n="2"/>which being a still rarer fault one puts up with
               that also.——I rejoice at <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Mr.
                  Macready's</persName> "wise
               determination"<!-- resp="#kdc": are we going to try to cross-ref this? -->—although
               there is something almost touching in the conscious infirmity of temper from whence
               it proceeds. I remember that <persName ref="#Cobbett_Wm">Mr. Cobbett</persName> once
               made a similar resolution &amp; from the same cause—he had too much curiosity.
               By the way there are many points of resemblance between those two <rs type="person" ana="#Macready #Cobbett_Wm">Worthies</rs>——both men of great power in
               their several ways (<persName ref="#Cobbett_Wm">Mr. Cobbett</persName> much the
               greater of course)----both men of headstrong passion——zealous partisans,
               vindictive enemies, fascinating companions——both great
               bullies—--&amp; as I suspect both great cowards. What do you think of this
               parallel in the manner of <persName ref="#Plutarch">Plutarch</persName>? It certainly
               is true.——</p><p>I send you some more scraps of <title ref="#CharlesI_MRMplay">"Charles"</title>. You
               <!-- resp="#kdc": small inkblot here. -->are to know that there
               will be an entirely new <emph rend="underline">first</emph> act (one scene of which
               you saw when last at <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading </placeName>) but that
               the rest of the piece will be merely a rifacimento of my old play, entirely altering
               the <emph rend="underline">tone</emph> of <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName> &amp; leaving out <persName ref="#Alice">Alice</persName><pb n="3"/> The only parts quite finished are the third &amp; fifth
               acts——most of the new bits of which I send you——The <emph rend="underline">last</emph> scene might perhaps be rendered more vivid, by giving
               even at that moment a hope for <persName ref="#Chas1_MRM">Charles</persName>
               ----bringing in <persName ref="#Fairfax">Fairfax</persName> sooner, &amp; sending a
               messenger to save him——but whether after the scene of the scaffold, &amp;
               with the known fate of the man before one's eyes, &amp; no <emph rend="underline">great</emph> Actor to bear one out it might not pass for a mere trick, or what
               would be worse an imitation of <persName ref="#Knowles_Sheridan">Mr.
                  Knowles</persName>, I do not know. You will see I hope a sustaining of <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName>, &amp; 
               a little improvement in <persName ref="#Chas1_MRM">Charles</persName>.----But it wants story
               terribly——It should introduce a plot to save him——but then I
               am afraid of a number more of people &amp; bad actors—--&amp; I could not bring
               it to any very great head, because there is no historical ground for the
               thing,----&amp; having in the <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" quantity="1"/><add place="above">old</add> three acts plenty of materials
               for the two news ones—--(always altering <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName> 
               as well as I can &amp; writing up <persName ref="#Chas1_MRM">Charles</persName>) why I hardly think the <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" quantity="1"/>introduction
               of a plot worth the trial. Do you? My firm belief is that the play <add place="above"><metamark rend="caret" place="below"/>written</add> as it will be, would succeed if acted, but <pb n="4"/> that it will not be acted——Either <persName ref="#Kemble_C">Charles Kemble</persName>'s own cowardice, or <rs type="person" ref="#Colman_the_Younger">the licenser's</rs> qualms, will prevent the representation. I mean on account of the cast of course for as to
               politics, it will be a high <orgName ref="#Tory">Tory</orgName> play. Is <add place="above"><metamark rend="caret" place="below"/>my</add><persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName> worse than <persName ref="#Cantwell">Cantwell</persName> in <title ref="#Hypocrite">The
                  Hypocrite</title>? It will be singularly unlucky, if with three plays either of which would succeed if fairly acted, neither
               should come out—--&amp; yet such I fully expect to be the case.----Perhaps
                  <title ref="#Foscari_MRMplay">Foscari</title> stands the best chance. <title ref="#Stage">The letter on the Stage</title> has been copied from <title ref="#Blackwoods">Blackwood</title> into the <title ref="#Observer">Observer</title>, probably sent thither officially from 
               <placeName ref="#Covent_Garden_Theatre">C.G.T.</placeName><note resp="#kdc">Covent Garden
                  Theater</note> &amp; is followed by an historical extract <note resp="#kdc">The
                  extract, titled, <title><placeName>Venice</placeName> in the Middle Ages</title>,
                  describes the trials and exile of <persName ref="#Foscari_son_hist">Jacopo Foscari</persName>, son of <persName ref="#Doge_F_hist">Francesco Foscari</persName>, the Doge of <placeName>Venice</placeName>.</note>
               containing the story of the <persName ana="#Doge_F_hist #Foscari_son_hist">Two

                  play</title> ----&amp; perhaps accidental, but still the coincidence struck me,
               &amp; I should not wonder if <persName ref="#Kemble_C">C. Kemble</persName> reckoned
               on <persName ref="#Fitzharris">Mr. Fitzharris</persName> for <persName ref="#Cosmo">Cosmo</persName>, which indeed he would both look &amp; play very beautifully——I know that <persName ref="#Kemble_C">Mr. Kemble</persName>
               has in no way lost his fancy for that piece, &amp; if <persName ref="#Young_CM">Mr. Young</persName> would play the 
               <persName ref="#Doge_F">Doge</persName> I think it would do very well.<note resp="#ebb">Manuscript at the Rylands Library is missing a closer. Ends at the bottom of the sheet.</note></p></div></body><back>
