               <p>To Sir W. Elford
               Bertram House Sept. 12th 1819.
             About fifty times I determined, my dear Sir William, to sustain my epistolary dignity &amp; never be betrayed into writing you three letters to one. But it is in vain-- the more I resolve the less I execute--especially when the resolution is a sort of unnatural holding one’s tongue-- So consoling myself with the sophistry that the letter which crossed yours cannot count for a bona fide letter--only a sort of a sidewind-- &amp; that I have only sent one epistle since--I write. My motive is partly a desire to prattle--partly a desire to hear--mostly the last.-- First of all you must condole with me. I have lost my poor Mossy. He died about a fortnight ago of a fit, exceedingly lamented by every body about the place &amp; most of all by me--  the faithfullest &amp; most intelligent creature in the world &amp; fonder of me than anything in it except just Mama and Papa. Are not you very sorry for poor Mossy? I remember so well your feeding him &amp; how well he understood when he was to take the meat. I am sure you will be sorry for poor Mossy. He was only 6 years old &amp; had eaten a hearty breakfast just the day he died-- but though so large &amp; strong looking a dog he had never been healthy.-- Then you must tell me that you have forgiving one breach of promise-- I assure you if I have not been to Bickham I have been no where else-- scarcely out of our own gates-- but sitting under the trees all day long reading, working, &amp; taming <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1">my</del> half the redbreasts &amp; black birds in the neighborhood-- a very lazy very happy life. Then when you have condoled &amp; pardoned you may say what you will--any thing--or nothing-- no not nothing English-- nothing French--des riens-- they make the best letters of any thing of my acquaintance as witness Madame de Sevigne-- Horace Walpole &amp; Sir William Elford. <pb n="2"/><!--(P1020279)--> Mrs. Dickinson is come home quite delighted with your Camilla criticism which is indeed admirable-- I have promised to show her that on the Bride of Lammermoor which she admires for those precise qualities which you &amp; I call faults! She won’t be converted-- but she will think it very clever (your critique I mean) nevertheless. The Legend of Montrose she did not much like in spite of Captain Dalgetty. By the way did I ever <del rend="strikethrough" unit="word" n="5">say to you that which</del><add place="above" resp="pencil">mention what</add> strikes me so much in reading that &amp; some other of Scott’s Characters-- that he is a greater favourite with the Author than he pretends-- that he makes believe to decry &amp; undervalue him just by a species of allowable coquetry to gain more surely the hearts of his readers. Shakespeare I think does that with some of his finest &amp; most intellectual characters--Falstaff, Shylock, Richard-- &amp; the reaction is felt even by those who do not observe the artifice. Perhaps this is only a fancy of mine-- but I have it-- &amp; where <metamark rend="caret" place="below"/><add place="above">is</add> that fancy which I do not tell you?--Oh I have been reading Opie’s Lectures-- Indeed Dr. Valpy having a spare copy gave them to me-- a very valuable gift in my opinion. Nothing can <del rend="squiggles" unit="word">give</del><add place="above">be</add>be a juster character than your phrase, “There is no standing still in them'-- all is clear sparkling running water-- no weeds, no scum, no mud. They give me a much higher idea of his powers than his paintings-- or rather having constantly before my eyes a coarse &amp; unpleasant specimen of his portraits I had allowed myself to be prejudiced against him-- naturally perhaps but certainly unfairly. (X) The lectures are very powerful--they have not Fuseli’s Italian Imagination, but they make up for that deficiency by a great fund of English good sense. I do not like them the less because they contradict Fuseli in the very points which made me stare so much. A great proof that Mr. Opie is right. Don’t you think so?-- Pray have you read Evelyn’s Memoirs? If not do. Begin forthwith-- &amp; do not shrug of your shoulders or look askew at the (x) It was a very fine picture of Dr. Milford &amp; the likeness <!--LMW: unclear: too the head was too ____ to satisfy the ideal ___
                     which the daughter took of his Majesty & shameless--><!--(P1020282)--> <pb n="3"/> bulk of the volumes--they are as entertaining as they are thick. I cannot give them a higher character. Perhaps I like them the better for the portion of history that they embrace--The reign of the Stuarts from Charles the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> to the Revolution has always been the part of English story that has had most attractions in my eyes-- After the Revolution all is as dull &amp; flat as a novel when the hero &amp; heroine are married, &amp; I would as soon read the long accounts of Miss Byron’s wedding dresses &amp; Sir Charles Grandison’s furniture, as the petty squabbles of William &amp; Mary &amp; Anne &amp; the Georges-- Now Evelyn not only gives you all the finest part of this grand fifty years drama but shows the Actors behind the scenes-- off the stage-- with their wigs thrown by &amp; their hoops off--You meet them at dinner parties &amp; at plays the Buckinghams, the Shaftesburys the Arlingtons the Clarendons-- all the cabal-- you talk with the King &amp; the Duke by land &amp; by water-- let houses to the Czar Peter &amp; show gardens to the Russells &amp; the Sidneys-- All the <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="3">personages of the</del>dramatis personae of the the Memoires de Grammont are before you &amp;
