Do we reproduce?  If we do, I don't think it will affect searchability, but it will look weird without the accompanying line breaks. LMW  err: I think we have decided not to reproduce these quotes at the beginning of each line, so I have simply enclosed the entire block quotation in one set of <quote> tags. However, we may need to modify that with information about what kind of quote this is.
