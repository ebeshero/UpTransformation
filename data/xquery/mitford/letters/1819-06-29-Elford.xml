Even I--though never having the pleasure of seeing him--had yet a feeling of acquaintance with <persName ref="#Champernowne_A">Mr. Champernowne</persName>. We had expected him, talked of him, thought of him--he had the goodness to come this way that we might enjoy the pleasure of <emph rend="underline">your</emph> company. Oh there are many men whom I know in all the ceremony of bowing &amp; curtsying that I should not have regretted half so much. I will talk no more on this distressing subject--but turn to the latter part of your letter your admirable critique &amp; analysis of <title xml:id="Camilla_FB">Camilla</title>. First of all I must beg leave to observe that I must have written even worse than ordinary if I could by any means convey to you the idea of disapproving the practice of reading to find fault. I rather think that I told you I was sometimes addicted to this practice myself. A piece of candour <!-- 2016-07-03 ALG: Confirm the word here is "candour." -->which however mentions it may appear was at least not very necessary to a person of your sagacity--inasmuch as full one half of the many reams of paper which you have had the trouble of reading or not reading signed <persName ref="#MRM">M. R. M.</persName> have been taken up with certain impertinent remarks which if not finding fault are very much like it--and ad to your one specimen of faultfinding it has given me so much pleasure that I very sincerely wish you may take to the custom. I never read so good a Review of a novel--or so fair a one--you give your reasons--which reviewers by profession never do--&amp; have <pb n="2"/>quite fortified me in my old opinions by telling me <emph rend="underline">why</emph> I thought so.

Mr. Dubster I abandon. Though he has an occasional mixture of oddity &amp; his self-pity resulting from his intense selfishness is extremely diverting--rarely I admit but still very diverting--don't you remember the "nobody never gives me nothing"--which is as good as any parallel passage in<!-- ALG 2016-07-03: Stopped here. --></p><p> <!--More body paragraphs as needed.

He served very briefly in Parliament (8 Nov. 1806 - 19 Feb. 1807), representing Saltash. His parliamentary career ended six days after his first, and only known, parliamentary action, a vote with the minority against the Grenville ministry. Champernowne traveled regularly to the Continent and purchased several paintings by Italian and Flemish Old Masters. The bulk of his collection was auctioned in 1820, after his death. In <title>Treasures of Art in Great Britain</title>, <persName>Gustav Friedrich Waagen</persName> named Champernowne among the "most distinguished collectors in England sinc 1792, who, by transplanting the most admirable works of art into their country, have conferred upon it a lasting benefit" (London: John Murray, 1854; Vol. I, pp. 26-27).
