               end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s
               spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate
               searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both
               Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling,
               following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and
               ligatured forms are not encoded.</p></editorialDecl></encodingDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div type="letter"><opener><dateline><name type="place">Three Mile Cross</name><date when="1821-11-22">Thursday</date> <!-- this date was a Thursday.

This is a mere question of stage effect &amp; a very slight alteration of the few lines I have written would be requisite either way. Perhaps if this end be chosen &amp; there should be nothing more material--or rather more troublesome--to send it back for--you would have the very great goodness to do this for me yourself. Once more a thousand thanks for your kindness &amp; a thousand good wishes from us all. I hope you are quite well again.</p><closer><lb/>Ever most sincerely your's,<lb/><signed><persName ref="#MRM">M.R.
