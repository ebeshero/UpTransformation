               unaltered. I have been altering them all the morning-turning &amp; twisting them
               twenty different ways-&amp; on an impractial survey of the several readings am
               convinced that your version is much the best. Mine all <emph rend="underline">patched</emph>. Indeed I write verses so seldom now that I have lost the little
               power I once possessed. The reason of my not sending you any of my attempts is, is that I
               fear your modesty or your politeness might tempt you to prefer my bad lines to your
               good lines &amp; I would not put such a risk in your way. Surely the last line is
               very <del rend="squiggles" n="1" unit="word"/> good--the repetition
               strengthens it. In addition to the greater cleanness of these last verses which we
               both prefer, they remind me much less of those in Manfred for which you know I took
               <!-- ds: ? --> the first you sent me, &amp; as your Picture though strikingly

               wish I was setting out for it this very moment. I did not want that dear letter to
               remind me of all that I love. And yet it has very much encreased my regret. I shall
               do nothing for a whole week but pity myself &amp; hate Mr. Eilliot. What pleasure I
               should have had in seeing with you such scenery as you describe-in meeting Miss
               Welsford who is so good to me &amp; whom I look upon as a ready made friend--in making
               acquaintance with your daughters who are I hope equally well disposed towards me--&amp;
