               shall know before I finish this letter &amp; will then tell you the particulars -- I
               am so sorry that they should inconvenience you -- So sorry that we should not
               ourselves have room for them -- So sorry that just now when you have so well earned
               every sort of pleasure, one so simple &amp; so
                  <unclear><supplied>fine</supplied></unclear> should be taken from you. These
               regrets are very useless -- but one cannot help feeling them. ---- Do not commit such
               a mistake <!-- "mis=take" --> &amp; so fancy your hand writing illegible
               <!-- "illegi=ble" --> -- I can read it as well as print -- The characters are
               peculiar but the moment one knows them by heart one reads them as easily as a scholar
               reads Greek. Oh my dear Mr. <persName>Haydon</persName> if only you were but to see
               some of the young-lady correspondences which <pb n="2"/><add hand="#rc">
                  <!-- Red crayon line diagonally from upper left corner to lower right corner --></add>
               befall one sometimes - a full sheet of foolscap twice crossed in a hand all Ms &amp;
               Ns -- a series of ups &amp; downs which defy guessing -- I was
                     <unclear><supplied>forced to turn off</supplied></unclear> a cousin of my own a
               delightful woman whose letters had but one fault that of being wholly unintelligible
               from beginning to end -- nothing could be prettier looking than her hand only it was
               utterly unreadable. Never think of calling that writing of yours which <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="word"/></del><add>shews</add> so plainly
               the <unclear><supplied>repricocity</supplied></unclear> &amp; energy of your spirit,
               a scrawl -- with what a delightful hieroglyphic you eked it out in your stage <persName type="fict">Iago</persName>! I have seen <persName type="hist">Kean</persName> both in <persName type="fict">Othello</persName> &amp; <persName type="fict">Iago</persName>, &amp; I felt
               like you his terrible power in the former. To see <persName type="hist">Kean</persName> in <persName type="fict">Othello</persName> is a very painful pleasure. If I may say it without
               danger of being suspected of affectation I must confess that I do not much like acted
               plays. <persName type="hist">Kean</persName> is disappointing &amp; unequal -- &amp; <persName type="hist">Kemble</persName> was cold -- &amp; one
               loses all the sweetness &amp; poetry of those delicious plays in these great theatres
               where nothing but the coarser strokes fell -- In short it is altogether owing to my
               intense love &amp; admiration <del rend="squiggles">of</del> for <persName type="hist">Shakespeare</persName> &amp;
               the old Dramatists that <pb n="3"/><add hand="#rc">

               I never desire to see a favorite play acted. Did you ever read two plays by
                  <persName type="hist">Thomas May</persName> the Historian of the Long Parliament which I
               wonder <persName>Mr. <unclear><supplied>Harbilt</supplied></unclear></persName> did
               not mention -- <bibl>The Heir</bibl> &amp; <bibl>The Old Couple</bibl>? They are
               as sweet &amp; beautiful as a May morning. <add hand="#rc"><!-- half-circle opening left or closing paren --></add> ---- 
               <addSpan spanTo="#p4"/><add hand="#rc"><!--Written vertically from bottom to top, parallel with fold. Describe this in zones?-->All in a little O<lb/>Sir William Elford</add> Do you read the Scotch novels Have you read <bibl>the Abbot</bibl>? Do you like
               it? I was disappointed beccause every alternate work has been excellent
               <!-- "excell=ent" --> &amp; as <bibl>the Monastery</bibl> was bad I expected this
               to be very good -- <del rend="hatch"><gap quantity="1" unit="letter"/></del> after
               all it is ungrateful <!-- "un=grateful" --> to impute as a fault the failure of one's
               own too high expectation -- It is very pleasant reading through not a work that would
               have made a reputation like <bibl>Waverly</bibl> or <bibl>Old Mortality</bibl>.
               The real fault lies in the subject. <persName type="hist">Mary Queen of Scots</persName> is a
               person of whom in spite of her sins we have dreamt all our life long. There is not a
               man of any imagination who has not made her romance in his own mind long before now
               -- The Bodleian Mary full of beauty &amp; grace - the love of men the
               envy of women - She who makes possible all that has been feigned of nymph of Goddess
               then <pb n="4"/>is no writing up to what one fancies of her.
                  --<persName type="hist">Schiller</persName> has tried &amp; <persName type="hist">Alfieri</persName> &amp;
               both have failed -- but though <persName type="hist">Sir Walter Scott's</persName> failure the
               most egregious of any - He takes the <persName type="myth">Venus</persName> down from her pedenstal
               &amp; makes her <unclear><supplied>scold</supplied></unclear> -- he disenchants the
                  <persName type="fict">Lady Dulcinea</persName> -- he lets the glaring daylight into the
               magic lantern &amp; puts out the dreamy
               pictures -- now this is not a friend's office - nor a poet's - This is another fault
               too -- All the plot that is not of <persName>Queen Mary</persName> is filled by a
               twin brother &amp; sister confusion, like that of <persName type="fict">Viola</persName>
               &amp; <persName type="fict">Sebastian</persName> in <bibl>Twelfth Night</bibl> -- &amp;
               let the <placeName>Edinburgh</placeName> reviewers say what they will
                  <persName type="hist">Walter Scott</persName> at the side of <persName type="hist">Shakespeare</persName>
               cuts no better a figure than <persName type="hist">Reynolds</persName> by the side of
                  <persName type="hist">Vandyke</persName>. Nevertheless the book is pleasant and free from his
               peculiar faults and from his stinking beauties -- only one <unclear><supplied>old
                     hag</supplied></unclear> -- no fortune scene - no prophecy &amp; no ghost. How
               sorry I am to hear so bad an account of Mr. <persName>Keats</persName> --When I write
               to <persName type="hist">Miss James</persName> I will mention your kind permission to send me his
               book. I am delighted that you were <anchor xml:id="p4"/> pleased with her letter <add hand="#rc"><!-- half-circle opening left or closing paren --></add> -- she is a
