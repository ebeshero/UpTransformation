           <handNote corresp="#rc" medium="red_crayon"> Red crayon or thick red pencil. Probably a different hand from Mitford's that marks many of her letters, sometimes drawing diagonal lines across pages, and sometimes writing words overtop and perpendicularly across Mitford's writing. A red line is drawn from top left to bottom right of each of the first three leaves. There is no red crayon across the address text block.</handNote>
           <handNote corresp="#pencil" medium="pencil"> Someone, apparently other than Mitford, perhaps cataloging letters and describing them, who left grey pencil marks and numbered her letters now in the Reading Central Library's collection. The pencil has inscribed the date "Feby 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1824" at the top left of the first leaf. This letter is also numbered "18" in the top center of the first leaf to the right of the opener.
           </handNote>
           <handNote corresp="#penAnnot_RCL" medium="pen">Someone, apparently other than Mitford, who occasionally left notes in a spidery thin hand to explain or document details in Mitford's letters in the margins of her pages, noted in the manuscripts held at Reading Central Library. This may be <persName ref="#Harness_Wm">William Harness</persName> or <persName ref="#Lestrange">A. G. L'Estrange</persName>. This letter labeled "To B R Haydon Esq."

              <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

             <note resp="#mjk">Pierre Etienne Louis Dumont, or Etienne Dumont, was in large part responsible for Bentham's popularity. Dumont was a minister in the Genevan Reformed Church, but he abandoned Geneva a year later due to political unrest and moved to Russia. In 1786 he relocated to England, where he met several prominent men through whom he met Bentham. In 1802, he published a three-volume edition of Bentham's works in Bruzelles, which created interest in the philosopher's work. Some scholars have called him a disciple of Bentham.</note>
