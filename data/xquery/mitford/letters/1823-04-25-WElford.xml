           <handNote xml:id="pencil" medium="pencil">Someone, apparently other than Mitford
              (perhaps cataloging the letters and describing them, or marking them up while
              creating an earlier edition of Mitford’s letters), left grey pencil marks and
              numbered her letters now in the Reading Central Library's collection. The date
              "April 26th 1823" is written in this hand on the top left of the last leaf of the letter.</handNote>
           <handNote xml:id="rc" medium="red_crayon">Red crayon or thick red pencil. Probably a
              different hand from Mitford's that marks many of her letters, sometimes drawing
              diagonal lines across pages, and sometimes writing words overtop and perpendicularly
              across Mitford's writing. On this letter, a red diagonal line is drawn from the top
              left to the bottom right of pages 2, 3, and 4 of the manuscript. The red crayon also strikes out a single word on page 4 of this letter, 9 lines from the bottom on the left margin.</handNote>
           <handNote xml:id="penAnnot_RCL"><!--2016-09-11 ebb: Here is a new handNote to document the annotator of page 3. Let's also indicate what the annotator wrote in place in the file, since this is a more informative and helpful annotation than we see from the red crayon. This seems like an editor's hand, so we'll enclose it in a <note> element inserted via <handShift> into the text of Mitford's letter.-->Someone, apparently other than <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName>, who occasionally left notes in a spidery thin hand to explain or document details in Mitford's letters in the margins of her pages, noted in the manuscripts held at <orgName ref="#ReadingCL">Reading Central Library</orgName>. This may be <persName ref="#Harness_Wm">William Harness</persName> or <persName ref="#Lestrange">A. G. L'Estrange</persName>. This annotator indicates the recipient as "Sir W. Elford" on the first page and has left a note at the bottom of page 3 that continues up the right margin.

           <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the
              end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s
              spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate
              searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both
              Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling,
              following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and
              ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>
