Notes: 	Sub-title varies: ser. 1, 1770-1829 ... or entertaining companion for the fair sex, appropriated solely to their use and amusement; ser. 2, v. 1-3, 1820-1822 ... or entertaining companion for the fair sex; ser. 2, v. 4-<10>, 1823-<1829> ... or mirror of the belles lettres, fashions, music, drama, &c.; -11, -1837, The Lady's magazine, & museum of the belles lettres, music, fine arts, drama, fashions, &c.
Ser. 4, v. 18 states that The Lady's magazine first appeared in the year 1756, and has been published monthly from that date.
Founded by John Coote, bookseller, who employed John Johnson as printer and John Wheble as publisher. After seven months, Mr. Coote sold his interest in it to Robinson & Roberts. Wheble was not informed, was aggrieved, and continued to issue subsequent numbers as a continuation of the original publication. Robinson & Roberts brought an action against Wheble on July 8, 1771. Wheble was fined one shilling, not for using the same title, but for connecting his magazine with the original. He continued publication for a considerable period under the original title.
