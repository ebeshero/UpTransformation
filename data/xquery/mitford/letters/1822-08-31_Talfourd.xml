Are you   
               superstitious enough to take such weather as an omen of prosperity &amp; happiness? I am. I have been watching it 
               from the bright morning to the golden sunset, thinking how much it resembled the brilliant daylight of your genius 
               &amp; character, &amp; wishing--oh how sincerely!--that the whole course of your future life may be as unclouded as 
               your wedding day. My <persName ref="#Mitford_Geo">Father</persName> &amp; <persName ref="#Russell_M">Mother</persName> are dining at <persName ref="#Valpy_Richard">Dr. Valpy</persName>'s--you can 
               imagine with how much delight &amp; enthusiasm your healths would be drunk there--I &amp; our little household did 
               not forget to do the same at home. You will not need to be told how cordially <persName ref="#Talfourd_Mrs">Mrs. 
               Talfourd</persName> is included in our good wishes, or with how deep an interest we look forward to the happiness of 
               being made known to her. It will be such a pleasure to talk to her of all that I owe to your kindness. Will she 
               accompany you to <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName> in <date when="1822-10">October</date>? I hope so. She should see with her own eyes &amp; hear 
               with her own ears the intense admiration with which <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName>, romantic only in that, regards 
               her husband.</p><pb n="2"/><p>How inimitably good you were to give a moment's thought to <title ref="#Foscari_MRMplay">Foscari</title> at such a 
               time. I returned <title ref="#Foscari_MRMplay">the Play</title> a day or two ago with the roses swept clear away from the first act--even 
               <persName ref="#Camilla">Camilla</persName>'s dream--the curse much modified--&amp; the <persName ref="#Doge_F">Doge</persName>'s part enlarged if 
               not improved at the conclusion--intimating that I would readily make any other alteration that might be desired. Do 
               you think there can be any doubt of its being acted? After <persName ref="#Kemble_C">Mr. and <persName ref="#Kemble_MrsC">Mrs. C. Kemble</persName></persName>'s assurances it is wrong even to ask such a question--but I 
               have got into a sad habit of fearing about that <title ref="#Foscari_MRMplay">Play</title>, &amp; am afraid even of making too 
               sure--&amp; you yourself, who are always so cheering &amp; comforting seemed not quite certain. Yet I ought not

               honest &amp; sincere--they set a seal upon his words--a man born with such a look is born to act rightly. Did you

               it. Certain of the

               words attributed to <persName ref="#Palmer_CF">Mr. Palmer</persName>--but it appears to be that the question is   
               purely personal &amp; individual &amp; does not concern any party or society whatsoever. I wonder that instead 
               <pb n="3"/> of referring the affair to this meeting <persName ref="#Palmer_CF">Mr. Palmer</persName> does 
               not take it up himself. Could not he prosecute these voracious Journalists in such a manner as to allow them to prove the truth of their story if 
               they could? And would not this be the best, the most public, the most unquestionable way of refuting the falsehood? 
               Besides the duty of exposing such libellers, it would really be worth while to undergo their slander to be defended
