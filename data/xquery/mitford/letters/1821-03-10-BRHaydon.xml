I return the two you ask for, &amp; I do not wait for a frank or a private conveyance because it appears to me that you would rather pay triple postage than not destroy them immediately. At the same time I feel myself bound to acknowledge that I mentioned to <persName ref="#James_Miss">Miss James</persName> something of what you said of <persName ref="#Scott_John">Mr. Scott</persName>--I shall write to her immediately &amp; transcribe for her benefit the expression of noble feeling which I now have before me, &amp; I know that she will admire &amp; respect you fifty times more than ever. I also, in writing an account of the Duel to a friend abroad, repeated nearly your words (but I hope &amp; believe without mentioning your name) as a proof that <persName ref="#Scott_John">Mr. Scott</persName>'s temper might possibly have been to blame. To her I shall also write in <gap reason="torn" unit="word" n="1"/><unclear><supplied resp="#ajc">a</supplied></unclear> day or two. After this confession, which I could not excuse <gap reason="torn" unit="chars" n="4"/><unclear><supplied resp="#ajc">myse</supplied></unclear>lf from making, can <del rend="squiggles"><gap unit="word" n="1"/></del> I ever expect to hear from you a<gap reason="torn" unit="chars" n="4"/><unclear><supplied resp="#ajc">gain</supplied></unclear>! I can only say that I intended no treachery--&amp; that I throw myself entirely upon your mercy. The Scotch letter <!--ajc "Scotch Letter": "Highest praise is accorded to the letters of Pope, Johnson, William Cowper, and Horace Walpole. But in addition to lengthy discussions of these writers, chapters such as "Grub Street Activity," "The Blue Stockings," and "The Scotch Letter Writers" demonstrate the book's value in also covering 18th-century letter writing of less renown" (Attributed to William Henry Irving's The Providence of Wit in the English Letter Writers, qtd. in Reader's Guide to Literature in English, Mark Hawkins-Dady, ed. (page 628)--><!--lmw:  appears to refer to one of the two letters by Haydon MRM is returning to him under cover with this one, about the Scott-Christie duel.-->is quite a different affair--I return it uncopied--but you will not find it so severe as you expect. Read it over before you burn it--&amp; if you like it better than you expected keep it for me. I hope you won't take a fancy to desire any more of your letters--I keep them like the apple of my eye.--There is no talking of this melancholy duel--it is too dreadful--He was with <persName ref="#Talfourd_Thos">Mr. Talfourd</persName> in good spirits that very morning. What a pity that he had not the firmness to say at once to <persName ref="#Lockhart_JG">Mr. Lockhart</persName> that he would not fight on a Literary quarrel.

I hope <persName ref="#Patmore_PG">Mr. Pattmore <choice><sic><reg resp="#ajc">Patmore</reg></sic></choice></persName> will be severely dealt with --<persName ref="#Lockhart_JG">Mr. Lockhart's</persName> feelings must be severely tried.--I hear from <choice><sic>every body</sic><reg resp="#ajc">everybody</reg></choice> of the surpassing beauty of your new picture.<!-- LMW:  identify which picture this is! --> Many thanks for the <title ref="#Examiner">Examiner</title>--How could he think of his crabbed politics when he was writing on such a subject!

This is my fault too--I liked the woman &amp; persuaded <persName ref="#Mitford_Geo">Papa</persName> to put the puppy there under the notion of its being taken better care of -- &amp; I can still by no means comprehend how a person with such a voice manner &amp; countenance can be dishonest--she looked like Truth itself.--Ah I am a sad blundering friend &amp; deserve to be turned off.--</p><closer>Adieu my dear <persName ref="#Haydon">Mr. Haydon</persName>--Forgive me if you can &amp; be sure that I am always most &amp; sincerely &amp; affectionately your's
