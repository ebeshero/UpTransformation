                     Communication at SUNY Potsdam, where she has taught since 2005. She is also the
                     Director of interdisciplinary Learning Communities for the campus, and
                     currently serves as Chair of Faculty Senate. Her areas of interest include
                     transatlantic Romantic and Victorian era literature, particularly women’s
                     writing and popular forms such as the Gothic novel and the literary ballad. She
                     is also interested in book history and bibliographical studies, particularly in
                     the study of authorship in the long nineteenth century (1780-1900). She has
                     published in <title level="j">European Romantic Review</title>, <title level="j">Romanticism on the Net</title> (now <title level="j">RaVon</title>), <title level="j">Romantic Circles</title>, <title level="j">Romantic Textualities</title>, and elsewhere. She is currently working on a
                     monograph on Romantic-period authorship and literary celebrity. Her work on
                     Digital Mitford thus far includes editing and coding Mitford’s “Introduction”
                     to her collected <title level="m">Dramatic Works</title> (1854), a critical
                     memoir that recounts the author’s influences and experiences at Covent Garden
                     and Drury Lane in the 1820s and 30s. It also includes researching Mitford’s
                     publication history for the site’s working bibliography, particularly tracking
                     the migration of Mitford’s stories from their first publication to their later
                     reappearances in collections and periodicals. A Founding Editor of Digital

                     since 2013 on transcribing, coding, and researching Mitford’s letters from 1819
                     to the early 1820s.

Before attending Montevallo, Sylvan spent a year and a half in Ireland with her mom (who thankfully is living back here in the US now), and she gained a lot of cultural knowledge and a love for the Irish countryside.  At UM, she found a love for studying nature and the environment in texts, especially in Romantic texts.  She has thoroughly enjoyed the Lake Poets and Mitford’s connections to the natural landscape in "Our Village.” She worked on the Digital Mitford Archive while enrolled in Samantha Webb’s Digital Romanticism course in Spring 2017.</note>

                     <p>Harness and <persName ref="#Byron">Byron</persName> were also friends from
                        their schooling at Harrow, as Byron sympathized with Harness’s experience of
                        a disabled foot, crushed in an accident in early childhood. Byron considered
                        dedicating <bibl>the first two cantos of <title>Childe Harold’s
                              Pilgrimage</title>
                        </bibl> to Harness, but refrained so as not to taint Harness’s reputation as
                        he was taking orders as an Anglican curate. Harness admired and encouraged
                        Mitford’s playwrighting in particular, and she commented that he was one of
                        the few of her friends who thought she should prioritize the drama over
                        prose. When <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">William Macready</persName> was
                        attacked in <bibl corresp="#Stage">an anonymous Blackwood’s Magazine piece
                           in 1825</bibl> for his demands and rudeness to Mitford over revisions to
                           <title ref="#Rienzi">Rienzi</title>, Macready assumed that Harness was
                        the author of the anonymous piece, though in <date when="1839">1839</date>
                        after many years of distance, Harness assured Macready in person that he was
                        not the writer, though he may have shared word of the poor treatment his
                        friend had endured.</p>
                     <p>William Harness was born on March 14, 1790 in Wickham, Berkshire to John
                        Harness, M.D. and Sarah Dredge; he was baptized at Whitchurch, Hampshire on
                        April 13, 1790. He received his B.A. in 1812 and his M.A. in 1816 from
                        Christ’s College, Cambridge. He served as curate at Kelmeston, Hampshire
                        (1812) and Dorking (1814-1816). He was preacher at Trinity Chapel, Conduit
                        Stree, London and minister and lecturer at St. Anne’s in Soho. He was Boyle
                        lecturer in London (1822) and was curate at Hampstead from 1828 to 1844. In
                        1825, he published an eight-volume edition of Shakespeare, including a
                        biography; his friends would later endow a prize in his name at Cambridge
                        for the study of Shakespearean literature. He also authored numerous essays
                        and reviews, some for the Quarterly Review. From 1844 to 1847 he was
                        minister of Brompton Chapel in London. He undertook to raise the funds to
                        build the church of All Saints, Knightsbridge, in the parish of St.
                        Margaret’s Westminster, which opened in 1849, and became perpetual curate of
                        that congregation. At the 1851 and 1861 censuses, he lived at 3 Hyde Park
                        Terrace, Westminster St. Margaret, Middlesex, with his sister Mary Harness
                        and his first cousin Jemima Harness, daughter of his uncle William. He died
                        on November 11, 1869 while on a visit to one of his former curates in
                        Battle, Sussex. At the time of his death he living at the same address at 3
                        Hyde Park Terrace; he is buried in Bath. </p>[Sources: <bibl>

                     engraving as it is now practiced. Although he did not invent the technique, he
                     is the best-known and one of the finest wood engravers employing a technique in
                     which hard boxwood is carved on the end-grain using metal-engraver’s tools.
                     This technique allows for the creation of finer and more detailed engraved

                     carved with the grain. Notable works of literary illustration include editions
                     of <persName ref="#Goldsmith">Oliver Goldsmith</persName>’s The Traveller and
                     The Deserted Village, Thomas Parnell’s The Hermit, and William Somervile’s The

                     General History of Quadrupeds, as well as a series of editions of Aesop’s
                     Fables. One of Bewick’s specialties was his tail- or tale-pieces, small
                     engraved illustrations used to fill gaps left by page breaks. </note>

                        and Ireland and James VII of Scotland</persName>. As such, he claimed the
                     English, Scottish and Irish thrones (as James III of England and Ireland and
                     James VIII of Scotland) after the death of his father in 1701. Scottish
                     supporters started "The Fifteen" Jacobite rising in Scotland in 1715, aimed at
                     putting him on the British throne, but the uprising failed. After his death,
                     the right to the Stuart succession was claimed by his son Charles Edward
                     Stuart.</note>

                     <!-- scw: See William Silver Darter [An Octogenarian], who names Warry of Minster Street, "an active liberal," as the person who was sent to France (41), although he says it was the 1812 election. See also the Monthly Magazine 12 (1801): 174 obituary for a Joseph Warry, boot and shoemaker of Reading, for 1801, which suggests the possibility that Mr. Warry may be his son who took over the business. Coles also puzzles over the name in one of Mitford's letters. -->Source:

                           Berkshire</placeName>. Through her siblings, Lady Madelina was connected
                        to several of the most influential aristocratic families in the country, and
                        Charles Fyshe Palmer’s marriage to Lady Madelina thus gained him access to

                     <p>A Whig politician, Palmer began running for Parliament elections as the

                        sometimes undermined his Whig reformist positions by referencing the noble

                     the daughter of Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, and Jane Maxwell, at
                     Gordon Castle, Bellie, Moray, Scotland. Her first husband was Robert Sinclair,
                     7th Baronet Sinclair; they married in 1789 and had one child, John Gordon
                     Sinclair. Her second husband was the Reading Whig politician <persName ref="#Palmer_CF">Charles Fyshe Palmer</persName>. They married in 1805 at
                     Kimbolton Castle in Kimbolton, Herefordshire. They lived at Luckley House,
                     Wokingham, Berkshire and at East Court, Finchampstead, Berkshire. Through her
                     siblings, Lady Madelina was connected to several of the most influential
                     aristocratic families in the country. Her sister Charlotte Gordon became
                     Duchess of Richmond through her marriage to Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of
                     Richmond, 4th Duke of Lennox and 4th Duke of Aubigny. Her sister
                        <persName>Susan Gordon</persName> became Duchess of Manchester through her
                     marriage to <persName>William Montagu, Duke of Manchester</persName>. Her
                     sister <persName>Louise Gordon</persName> became Marchioness Cornwallis through
                     marriage to <persName>Charles Cornwallis, Marquess of Cornwallis</persName>.
                     Her sister <persName>Georgiana Gordon</persName> became Duchess of Bedford
                     through marriage to <persName>John Russell, Duke of Bedford</persName>. Her
                     brothers were <persName>George Duncan Gordon</persName>, who became 5th Duke of
                     Gordon, and <persName>Lord Alexander Gordon</persName>. <persName ref="#Palmer_CF">Charles Fyshe Palmer</persName>’s marriage to Lady Madelina
                     thus gained him access to aristocratic houses, including the <orgName ref="#HollandHouse">Holland House</orgName>. Lady Madelina’s name is
                     variously spelled <q>Madelina</q> and <q>Madalina</q>, although <q>Madelina</q>
                     appears to be the more common and standard spellling of the name, as an
                     anglicization of the French Madeline. For more on the Palmers, see note 2 in

                     1843. He consistently gives his birthplace as "Three Mile Cross" on census
                     documents from the second half of the nineteenth century. His occupation is
                     given as "clerk in holy orders." Since he disappears from English census
                     records after 1861, reappearing in 1891, and gives his son Arthur Harry
                     Edmund’s birthplace as Isipingo, Natal, South Africa (then a British colony),
                     it seems possible that he emigrated to South Africa between those dates, then
                     returned to England. Further research needed.</note>

                     <p>Richard Valpy (the fourth of that name) was the eldest son of Richard Valpy
                        [III] and Catherine Chevalier. He was born on December 7, 1754 at St.
                        John’s, Jersey, Channel Islands. He was a friend and literary mentor to
                           <persName ref="#MRM">Mary Russell Mitford</persName>. He matriculated at
                        Pembroke College, Oxford University on April 1, 1773, aged eighteen, as a
                        Morley scholar. He received from Oxford a B.A. (1776), M.A. (1784), B.D.
                        &amp; D.D. (1792). He took orders in the Church of England in 1777. Richard
                        Valpy served as Second Master at Bury School, Bury, Huntindonshire from 1771
                        to 1781, and was also collated to the rectory of Stradishall, Suffolk, in
                        1787. He became the Headmaster at Reading School, Reading, Berkshire, in
                        1781 and served until 1830, at which time he turned the Headmastership over
                        to his youngest son Francis E. J. Valpy and continued in semi-retirement
                        until his death in 1836. During his tenure as Headmaster of <placeName ref="#Reading_School">Reading Grammar School</placeName> for boys over
                        the course of fifty years, he expanded the boarding school and added new
                        buildings. He is the author of numerous published works, including Greek and
                        Latin textbooks, sermons, volumes of poetry, and adaptations of plays such
                        as Shakespeare’s King John and Sheridan’s The Critic. His <bibl>Elements of

                        used as school texts throughout the nineteenth century. Valpy’s students
                        performed his own adaptations of Greek, Latin, and English plays for the
                        triennial visitations and the play receipts went to charitable
                        organizations. Valpy enlisted Mitford to write reviews of the productions
                        for the <title ref="#ReadingMer_per">Reading Mercury</title>. In 1803, his
                        adaptation of Shakespeare’s King John was performed at Covent Garden

                     Wakefield, which seems likely, cross-checking with the ODNB. Wakefield’s mother
                     was the Quaker writer Priscella Bell Wakefield, though Wakefield himself
                     converted to the Church of England. He published <title>An Essay of Political
                        Economy</title> in 1799, and qualified for the law in 1807. His first wife,
                        <persName>Isabella Mackie</persName>, swindled him of much of his income and
                     nearly bankrupted him, before she fatally poisoned herself in August 1813.
                     Later that year, 11 November 1813, Wakefield married <persName>Elizabeth
                        Kilgour</persName>. He was eventually very successful and much consulted on

See also the Monthly Magazine 12 (1801): 174 obituary for a Joseph Warry, boot and shoemaker of Reading, for 1801, which suggests the possibility that Mr. Warry may be his son who took over the business.

                  <note resp="#lmw">The Punch and Judy slapstick puppet shows of England had their
                     roots in the 16th-century Italian commedia dell’arte tradition. The figure of
                     Punch derives from the Neapolitan stock character of Pulcinella, whose name was
                     anglicized "Punchinello" and shortened to "Punch." 17th- and 18th-century shows
                     in England were performed with marionettes on fixed stages. By the end of the
                     18th century, shows were performed using glove puppets on mobile puppet booths
                     and found a home on the nineteenth century on the beaches of English seaside
                     resorts and evolved into children’s entertainments in the Victorian era. Mr.
                     Punch is the traditional protagonist of such shows; episodic plots normally
                     involve Punch beating his wife and other characters with his "slapstick" and

                     This led to the "old price (or O.P.) riots" and the eventual lowering of ticket

                  <note>Historically, a four thousand acre tract of heathland outside London near
                     Hounslow in the county of Middlesex, crossed by major routes between London and
                     the west and southwest of England. In <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName>’s
                     time, the heath was crossed by the Great West Road and the Bath Road and, as it
                     had been in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, was still known as a
                     dangerous spot for unwary travellers who might find themselves robbed by
                     highwaymen or footpads. From at least the English Civil Wars until World War
                     II, the heath has been used as a military staging area and training ground.
                     Today, all that remains of the heath is two hundred acres preserved as
                     parkland.</note>

                     printing themselves and printed only 50 copies, because the bankrupt Duke could
                     not finance the venture. In her February 27, 1819 letter to Elford, Mitford
                     indicates that she does not expect him to buy a copy, since he is "a great deal
                     too wise to deal in books printed upon drawing paper in Atlas quarto--books
                     merely meant to make a show." It is unknown how many copies were sold.</note>

That means that I have no idea what happens in 1819, if series one ceases publication in December 1818, as sources indicate. Sometimes the numbering can be off from the actual month/year that the issue was published, and this may have led to the bibliographic confusion of dates.

                  <!--SCW: More research may be needed on the reprint history of the Christmas Amusements series. They are essentially charades and dramatics. Edinburgh Tales is an anthology of Tait's Edinburgh Magazine publications, which had been Johnstone's Edinburgh Magazine prior to June 1834, and based on the repub of CA in Edinburgh Tales, my sense it that CA were published there first. I wasn't able to find copies of then online to verify and date.-->

                  <author>
                     <persName ref="#Dickinson_Charles">Charles Dickinson</persName>
                  </author>
                  <date when="1795"/>
                  <publisher>published for the author [Charles Dickinson]</publisher>
                  <note resp="#lmw">First published in 1795 and privately printed by Charles
                     Dickinson himself. Period records suggest that the poem was available in at
                     least four different forms: as individual quarto cantos sold for 1 shilling
                     each (some listing ’White’ as the name of the publisher, although this may be a
                     bookseller); as a 1796 quarto complete edition of all sixty-six cantos; as
                     partial quarto editions of the middle 40 cantos (possibly gathered from
                     individual cantos, as each were numbered separately); and a 12mo. complete
                     edition in two volumes, with 389 pages listed as printed at Farley-Hill in
                     1820, of which only 12 copies were made and which were presentation copies to
                     Dickinson’s friends. Some editions appear "in boards," others in "half
                     morocco." An auction catalog for Richard Valpy’s library indicates that there
                     were "only 12 copies, printed by the author himself, who presented this to me
                     (ie, Richard Valpy);" another presentation copy appears in an auction catalogs
                     for Samuel Rogers’s library. Periodicals and their reviewers from 1796 do not
                     appear to have had access to the complete work in 66 cantos but instead review
                     partial editions of cantos 41-60 (Edinburgh Magazine); canto 38 only
                     (Analytical Review); Cantos 38-60 (British Critic); Cantos 38 and 40 only
                     (Monthly Review). WorldCat lists an edition of cantos 37 to 60 only from 1795.
                     Separate listings for a two-page mock title-page for the work, attributed to
                     Horne-Took, appear as "Speedily will be published, price 3l.6s. in boards, The
                     travels of Cyllenius: a poem. In sixty-six cantos." </note>

This selected edition of <title ref="#OV">Our Village</title> compiles stories from across the five volumes, and arranges them in the order in which they originally appeared. The only exception to this ordering is what was the introduction to <title ref="#OurVillage_5th">the fifth volume</title>, <title ref="#Intro_Farewell_to_OV_v5">Introduction: Farewell to Our Village</title>, which becomes the last story in the volume; moving the "farewell" to the last position appears to be a common practice with editors of selected editions.</note>

This volume featured an extensive Introduction by <persName ref="#Ritchie_AnneT">Anne Thackeray Ritchie</persName> and new black and white illustrations by <persName ref="#Thomson_Hugh">Hugh Thomson</persName>. The volume reprints the <title ref="#Walks_Country_OV">"Walks in the Country"</title> subseries of sketches and re-orders them chronologically to follow the seasons, winter-spring-summer-fall; a choice and ordering of stories that others would follow. The firm produced a limited-run "large paper" edition in red cloth as well as a "small paper" quarto edition bound in green cloth, some with gilt-stamped covers. The "small paper" green cloth editions featured illustrated covers and spines heavily stamped in gold, and followed a book design strategy that had been established by <orgName ref="#Macmillan_pub">Macmillan</orgName> in 1891 with editions of <persName ref="#Gaskell_Eliz">Gaskell</persName>'s <title ref="#Cranford">Cranford</title> and <persName ref="#Goldsmith">Goldsmith</persName>'s <title ref="#Vicar_Wakefield">Vicar of Wakefield</title>; these editions were also illustrated by <persName ref="#Thomson_Hugh">Hugh Thomson</persName> and were popular as gift books. The large paper edition was limited to 470 copies and used the same illustration plates as the small paper edition.</note>

That version consists of two distinct parts, the first in which the narrator gathers flowers with a friend, and the second, entitled <title>"The Wood"</title>, in which they come across a wood in the process of being cut down. In <title ref="#OV">Our Village</title>, only the first part of <title ref="#Walks_TheCopse_LM">The Copse</title> was republished under that title. The second section of <title ref="#Walks_TheCopse_LM">The Copse</title> was republished as a separate sketch, <title ref="#Walks_TheWood_OV">The Wood</title> in <title ref="#OV">Our Village</title>. The theme of the denuded forest as well as certain passages strongly echo those of <title ref="#Walks_Country_LM">Walks in the Country</title>, number nine, <title ref="#Walks_WoodCutting_LM">Wood-Cutting</title>.</note>
