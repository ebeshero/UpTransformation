                    <hi rend="underline">About the Text</hi>
                  <lb/>
                    The text from these four editions remains essentially the same. There are three major differences. The first is that this chapter is 17 pages in the 1st ed., and 18 pages in the 2nd - 4th eds. 
                    This means an extra page plus one line (i.e. 39 lines) have been inserted in the 2nd-4th editions beginning on line 7 of page 57 and spanning over to line 8 of page 58. The text, from page 37 of the 1st ed., 
                    then resumes where it left off in the third paragraph of page 58 (i.e. line 9). The second difference is that in the 1st edition many words are contractions or not spelled out in full, 
                    as in line 31(32 in the 4th edition) where the 1st edition spells "acknowledg'd" and the 2nd - 4th eds. spell out the word in full as "acknowledged." 
                    The third difference is that the text of the 1st - 3rd editions begins on line 14, whereas 4th edition begins on line 15, moving the whole body of the text one line on this page. 
                    This is not recorded as a difference with highlighting, as it would mean the whole of the first page of the 4th ed. would be highlighted.</p>
