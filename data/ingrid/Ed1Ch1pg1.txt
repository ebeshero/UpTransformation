
CHAP. I. 
 OF
 Captain AVERY,
 And Others of his Crew  

NONE of these bold Adventurers were
ever so much talked of, for a while,
as Avery he made as great a Noise in the
World as Meriveis does now, and was looked upon
to be a Person of as great Consequence ; he was re-
presented in Europe, as one that had raised himself
to the Dignity of a King, and was likely to be the
Founder of a new Monarchy ; having, as it was said,
taken immense Riches, and married the Great Mo-
guls Daughter, who was taken in an Indian Ship,
which fell into his Hands ; and that he had by her
many Children, living in great Royalty and State;
that he had built Forts, erected Magazines, and
was  Master of a stout Squadron of Ships, man'd  with 
able and desperate Fellows of all Nations; that
he gave Commissions out in his own Name, to the
Captains of his Ships, and to the Commanders of
his Forts, and was acknowledg'd by them,  as their
Prince. A Play was writ upon him, call'd, the Suc-
cessful Pyrate ; and, these Accounts obtainâ€™d such 
Belief, that several Schemes were offer'd to the
Council, for fitting out a Squadron to take him;
while others were for offering him,  and his Compa- 
nions,  an Act of Grace, and inviting them to  Eng-
land with all  their Treasure, least his growing 
Greatness
