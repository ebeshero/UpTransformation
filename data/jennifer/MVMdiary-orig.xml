                        Montgomery</ref>was moved with other family belongings to <ref
                        target="#pla.00009">Mound Bayou, Mississippi</ref> in 1887-88. It was likely
                     passed down to Mary Cordelia Montgomery Booze, the daughter of <ref
                        target="#per.00005">Isaiah Montgomery</ref> and <ref target="#per.00006"
                        >Martha Robb Montgomery</ref>. In 1971, the diary was donated to the Library
                     of Congress by Booze's daughter, Eugenia Booze Wood, and writer and educator
                     Gladys Byram Shepperd. </provenance>
