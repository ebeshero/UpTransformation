# XPath for Document Archeology and Project Management
## course number 44
### offered in week 2 of the [Digital Humanities Summer Institute: 11-15 June, 2018](http://www.dhsi.org/courses.php) 

### Description: 
Learn XPath intensively and gain superpowers with XML processing! Whether you’ve recently learned XML and want to build something with it, or whether you’ve worked with XPath before but are rusty, new and experienced coders will benefit alike from our course. XPath is usually not the center of class, and people often gain hasty "ad hoc" experience with it, without understanding how much it can do. Concentrating intensively on XPath will "power up" what you can do with XML, and will help you refine the way you code your documents. Our course will assist XML coders (whether beginnners or experienced) with complex processing of information from markup and from plain text. Our goals are 1) to share strategies for systematically building archives and databases, and 2) to increase participants’ confidence and fluency in extracting information coded in XML in those archives and databases. 

Because we can “dig” latent information out of the document “strata” of texts, we think of working with XPath as something like planning an archaeology project, turning an XML project into a carefully managed digital dig site for cultural data! 
In our course you’ll gain experience with writing precise and powerful XPath to illuminate information that isn’t obvious on a human reading. We'll apply XPath to check for accuracy of text encoding--to write schema rules to manage your coding (or your project team's coding). You'll learn how XPath can help you to build exciting visualizations from XML code (such as to make a chart like a timeline or a network graph). We'll write XPath to calculate how frequently you’ve marked a certain phenomenon, or locate which names of people are mentioned together in the same chapter, paragraph, sentence, stanza, footnote, or other structural unit. 

XPath is the center of the course, but we will show you how it applies in multiple XML processing contexts so that you learn how these work similarly and how these are used, respectively, to validate documents and to transform them for publication and other reuse. Thus, we devote serious, sustained attention to writing *and* applying XPath by surveying how it is expressed in a variety of frameworks (including XSLT, XQuery, and Schematron), with a variety of materials (including XML and plain-text documents), and involving a variety of task types (such as “date arithmetic” to calculate how much time elapsed between dates and “string surgery” to look for and manipulate patterns inside your coded elements). You'll gain fluency with XPath expressions and patterns, including sequence expressions, type expressions, regular expressions, predicates, operators, functions (from the core library and user-defined), and other features, and we'll practice these in different XML-related contexts (including XSLT, XQuery, and Schematron). Whether you are an XML beginner or a more experienced coder, you’ll find that strengthened skills in XPath will help you with systematic encoding, document processing, and project management. 

*This is a hands-on course. Consider this offering in complement with, and / or to be built on by: Text Encoding Fundamentals and their Application, Out-of-the-Box Text Analysis for the Digital Humanities, Text Processing - Techniques & Traditions, XML Applications for Historical and Literary Research. No advanced knowledge is necessary but those with interests in document processing who have taken Digital Documentation and Imaging for Humanists; Advanced TEI Concepts / TEI Customization; A Collaborative Approach to XSLT; or Geographical Information Systems in the Digital Humanities will benefit.*
