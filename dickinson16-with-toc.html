   			In Praise of the Three Kāyas
   		
   		
   		
   			Homage to the Buddha!
   		
   		
   			What is neither one nor many, the foundation of great and excellent benefit for oneself
   and others,
   			Neither an entity nor the lack of an entity, of equal taste like space, of a nature
   difficult to perceive,
   			Untainted, changeless, peaceful, unequalled, all-pervading, and free from reference
   points—
   			To the incomparable dharmakāya of the Victors, which is to be personally experienced,
   I pay homage. [1]
   		
   		
   			What is beyond the world, inconceivable, the very embodiment of the fruition of hundreds
   of excellent accomplishments, and magnificent,
   			Displays great variety in the middle of a retinue due to being the cause for the pleasure
   of the wise,
   			And is the Buddhas' unceasing, eloquent melody of the genuine dharma, resounding in
   all the worlds—
   			To the sambhogakāya, residing in the kingdom of the great dharma, I pay homage. [2]
   		
   		
   			As the cause for maturing sentient beings, sometimes, it shines like the blaze of
   a fire,
   			At others, it appears as buddhahood, the wheel of dharma, or as gaining peace,
   			Operating in various ways, it dispells the fear of threefold existence through all
   kinds of means—
   			To the nirmānakāya of the Sages, the great welfare that pervades the ten directions,
   I pay homage. [3]
   		
   		
   			Liberated from the conduct of the three realms, equal to the sky, the nature of all
   entities,
   			Pure, peaceful, free, embodying utter serenity, to be realized by yogins,
   			Difficult to realize, hard to examine, the benefit of oneself and others, all-encompassing,
   and causeless–
   			To the kāya of the Victors in its single form, which is blissful, unequalled, and
   nonconceptual, I pay homage. [4]
