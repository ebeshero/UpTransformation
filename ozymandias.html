      <h1>Ozymandias</h1>
      <h2>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h2>
      <p>Published in <i>The Examiner</i>, London: 11th January, 1818</p>
      <div class="poem">
        I met a traveller from an antique land, <span class="lineNum">1</span>
         <br/>
        Who said—Two vast and trunkless legs of stone  <span class="lineNum">2</span>
         <br/>
        Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand, <span class="lineNum">3</span>
         <br/>
        Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, <span class="lineNum">4</span>
         <br/>
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, <span class="lineNum">5</span>
         <br/>
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read <span class="lineNum">6</span>
         <br/>
        Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <span class="lineNum">7</span>
         <br/>
        The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; <span class="lineNum">8</span>
         <br/>
        And on the pedestal, these words appear: <span class="lineNum">9</span>
         <br/>
        My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; <span class="lineNum">10</span>
         <br/>
        Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! <span class="lineNum">11</span>
         <br/>
        Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <span class="lineNum">12</span>
         <br/>
        Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare <span class="lineNum">13</span>
         <br/>
        The lone and level sands stretch far away.” <span class="lineNum">14</span>
      </div>
   </body>
